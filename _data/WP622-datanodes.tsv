GI	GeneProduct	:AT1G22770-TAIR-G	promotes flowering by acting upstream of CO (CONSTANS), FT (FLOWERING TIME) and SOC1 (SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO1)							
ELF3	GeneProduct	:AT2G25930-TAIR-G	EARLY FLOWERING 3 interacts with PHYB							
FKF1	GeneProduct	:AT1G68050-TAIR-G	FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F BOX 1 is clock-controlled and regulates transition to flowering.							
CCA1	GeneProduct	:AT2G46830-TAIR-G	CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 is a transcriptional repressor and works similar to LHY in a regulatory feedback loop.							
PIF6	GeneProduct	:AT3G62090-TAIR-G	PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 6 is a Myc-related bHLH transcription factor and physically interacts with TOC1.							
TOC-1	GeneProduct	:AT5G61380-TAIR-G	TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 is involved in generating circadian rythm and shortens the span of circumnutation rate. TOC1 interacts with ZTL.							
LHY	GeneProduct	:AT1G01060-TAIR-G	LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 1 is a transcription factor involved in circadian rythm along with MYB transcription factor.							
ELF4	GeneProduct	:AT2G40080-TAIR-G	EARLY FLOWERING 4 controls circadian rhythms and flowering time

COP1	GeneProduct	:AT2G32950-TAIR-G								
FLC	GeneProduct	:AT5G10140-TAIR-G	FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is a transcription factor that functions as a repressor of floral transition and contributes to temperature compensation of the circadian clock. Its expression is downregulated during cold treatment.							
FRI	GeneProduct	:AT4G00650-TAIR-G	Loss of function of FRIGIDA (FRI) results in early flowering.							
FCA	GeneProduct	:AT4G16280-TAIR-G	It is an RNA-binding protein that promotes transition of vegetative meristem to reproductive mesitem and is involved in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing.							
SPY	GeneProduct	:AT3G11540-TAIR-G	SPINDLY (SPY) encodes for the enzyme N-acetyl glucosamine transferase that may glycosylate molecules involved in GA signaling. SPY acts as both a repressor of GA responses and as a positive regulation of cytokinin signalling. [imported from TAIR http://arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?id=36698&type=locus]							
LD	GeneProduct	:AT4G02560-TAIR-G	LUMINIDEPENDENS (LD) is a positive regulator of flowering in the autonomous pathway. Its functional disruption results in delayed flowering.
