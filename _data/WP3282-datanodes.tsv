PIP3	Metabolite	hmdb:HMDB0010147	PIP3 is a membrane lipid generated from PIP2 by the enzyme P13K. PIP3 has a PH binding domain that can be recognized by PLC-g, Itk, and Atk.							inchikey:ZSZXYWFCIKKZBT-LBWXJXETSA-N
Ca2+	Metabolite	hmdb:HMDB0000464	Calcium ions are second messengers, small-molecule biochemical mediators. Calcium is released from the ER by IP3. It diffuses throughough the cell enabling the signal to activate a variety of taget proteins. A certain calcium ion concentration must be acheived before targets can be activated.						chebi:29108;chebi:29108	inchikey:BHPQYMZQTOCNFJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N

LCK	GeneProduct	ensembl:ENSBTAG00000012695	Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase - Lck in its inactive state is bound to CD4/CD8 cytoplasmic tail and it's terminal tyrosine is phosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of this amino acid (by tyrosine phosphotase CD45 -- CD4/CD8 binding its ligand) causes a conformations change in LcK and it becomes an active tyrosine kinase.  LcK is activated when the extracellular part of CD8 binds its (MHC:peptide) ligand. Lck is a Src family kinase that is constitutively expressed. It phosphorylates all TCR ITAMS.  Rephosphorylation of this carboxyl-terminal tyrosine by Csk returns Lck to the inactive state.  Basically, Lck is bound to CD8. When CD8 binds MHC:peptide, Lck gets activated and can phosphorylate nearby ITAMs.</br>Homology Mapping from Homo sapiens to Bos taurus: Original ID = L:3932	ensembl:ENSBTAG00000012695	ncbigene:508890		uniprot:A0A3Q1MDN9;uniprot:Q3ZCM0			
ZAP70	GeneProduct	ensembl:ENSBTAG00000005892	ZAP-70 is kinase that becomes activated after phosphorylation. It contains to tandem SH2 domains that bind to phosphorylated ITAMs on the TCR complex cytoplasmic tails.   It docks at the TCR (requires both ITAM positions to be phosphorylated), is then phosphorylated by Lck, and then recruits other signaling proteins.</br>Homology Mapping from Homo sapiens to Bos taurus: Original ID = L:7535	ensembl:ENSBTAG00000005892	ncbigene:504509		uniprot:E1BMP9			
PLCG1	GeneProduct	ensembl:ENSBTAG00000017584	PLC-g is a phospholipase, a class of enzymes that cleave phospholipids just before the phosphate group.  PLC-g is initially brought to the plasma membrane by binding of its PH domain to membrane lipid PIP3. PLC-g then binds to LAT and SLP-76 and can be activated by Itk mediated phosphorylation.  PLC-g ultimately produces 3 different second messangers to activate 3 paths leading to different TFs that lead to IL-2 transcription</br>Homology Mapping from Homo sapiens to Bos taurus: Original ID = L:5335	ensembl:ENSBTAG00000017584	ncbigene:281987		uniprot:F1MYF9			
AKT1	GeneProduct	ensembl:ENSBTAG00000017636	Akt is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that plays a key role in many cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, apoptosis, cell proliferation, transcription, and cell migration.  Akt is recruited to the membrane by PIP3. Here Akt can be activated / phosphorylated (indirectly) by P13K and can then phosphorylate a variety of downstream pathways. Noteably, Akt promotes cell survival by inhibiting the cell death pathway and stimulates cell metabolism by increasing the utilization of glucose.</br>Homology Mapping from Homo sapiens to Bos taurus: Original ID = L:207	ensembl:ENSBTAG00000017636	ncbigene:280991		uniprot:A0A3Q1MJ77;uniprot:G3X7B5

CTLA4	GeneProduct	ensembl:ENSBTAG00000013170	Expression is enhanced by IL-2. Function is controlled largely by regulation of its surface expression. Initially CTLA-4 is in the intracellular membrane but moves to the cell surface after T-cell receptor signaling. When CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail is NOT phosphorylated it binds to AP-2 (clathrin adapter molecule) and is removed from the surface. When the tail is phosphorylated AP-2 cannot bind and CTLA-4 is expressed on the surface. CTLA-4 competes with CD28 for B7 ligand, and it has a higher affinity of B7 in part because CTLA-4 binds B7 in a dimer. CTLA-4 interfers with the formation of lipid rafts, TCR:ZAP70 microclusters, and central supramolecular activation complex.</br>Homology Mapping from Homo sapiens to Bos taurus: Original ID = L:1493	ensembl:ENSBTAG00000013170	ncbigene:281732		uniprot:Q28090
