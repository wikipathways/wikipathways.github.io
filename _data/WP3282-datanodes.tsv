LCK	GeneProduct	ensembl:ENSBTAG00000012695	"Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase - Lck in its inactive state is bound to CD4/CD8 cytoplasmic tail and it's terminal tyrosine is phosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of this amino acid (by tyrosine phosphotase CD45 -- CD4/CD8 binding its ligand) causes a conformations change in LcK and it becomes an active tyrosine kinase.  LcK is activated when the extracellular part of CD8 binds its (MHC:peptide) ligand. Lck is a Src family kinase that is constitutively expressed. It phosphorylates all TCR ITAMS.  Rephosphorylation of this carboxyl-terminal tyrosine by Csk returns Lck to the inactive state.  Basically, Lck is bound to CD8. When CD8 binds MHC:peptide, Lck gets activated and can phosphorylate nearby ITAMs.</br>Homology Mapping from Homo sapiens to Bos taurus: Original ID = L:3932"	ensembl:ENSBTAG00000012695	ncbigene:508890		uniprot:A0A3Q1MDN9;uniprot:Q3ZCM0
