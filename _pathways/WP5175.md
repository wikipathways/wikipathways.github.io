description: 'Ketone bodies, acetoacetate and (beta)3-hydroxybutyric acid, are produced
  in times of hunger/starvation. The compounds are water-soluble (and also include
  the spontaneous breakdown product of acetoacetate, acetone). All ketone bodies are
  by-products when fatty acids are broken down for energy in the liver and kidneys,
  and used as energy source for the heart and brain.  Ketogenesis can be impeded by
  inborn errors of metabolism such as Methylacetoacetyl-CoA thiolase deficiency, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  synthase deficiency and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency.  In this
  pathway ketogenesis is visualised and linked to the different diseases. Ketogenesis
  can derive from leucine metabolism and fatty acid beta-oxidation and happens in
  the mitochondria. The enzymes ACAT1, HMGCS2, HMGCL and BDH1 play an important role
  during this proces.  This pathway is based on chapter 23 of the book of Blau et
  al. (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)), Figures 23.1 and 23.2.  For the ketolysis
  pathway see: [WP5195](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5195) '
