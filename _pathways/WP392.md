description: 'The tripeptide glutathione (GSH: L-γ-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) is
  a prevalent intracellular thiol that is able to act as a cellular redox buffer due
  to its low redox potential. GSH is involved in many biological processes including:
  protein and DNA synthesis; amino acid transport; enzyme regulation; protection of
  cells against reactive oxygen compounds and free radicals, xenobiotics and heavy
  metals. GSH can also be used as a source of sulfur and cysteine.  Reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide and alkylperoxides produced by various metabolic
  processes can cause irreversible oxidative damage to the cell if they are not rapidly
  detoxified by antioxidant defenses. The redox-active sulphydryl group of GSH can
  protect cells from ROS by directly scavenging free radicals and acting as a cofactor
  for antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidases (Gpx1p, Gpx2p and Gpx3p).
  Glutathione oxidized in this manner forms glutathione disulphide (GSSG), which is
  recycled back to GSH by the enzyme glutathione reductase (Glr1p). Some glutathione
  peroxidases such as Gpx2p, however, may be re-reduced by the thioredoxin system
  rather than the glutathione-glutaredoxin system.  GSH also protects the cell from
  xenobiotics and heavy metals through the formation of GSH S-conjugates and their
  subsequent export in the vacuole or directly out of the cell. Some xenobiotics can
  react spontaneously with the thiol moiety of GSH to form GSH S-conjugates, while
  others react through GSH S-transferases (GST). Two GSTs (Gtt1p and Gtt2p) were identified
  in yeast and shown to have GST activity with 1-chloro-2,4-dintrobenzene. In yeast
  the GSH conjugates are transported to the vacuole by the GS-X pump Ycf1p or directly
  out of the cell by other GS-X pumps.  Description from [yeastgenome.org](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/).'
