description: Diagrammatic scheme depicting targeted p53 pathway-related genes by upregulated
  miRNAs in prostate tumor cells. An integrated in silico and computational prediction
  databases (DIANA-micro T-CDS, miRBase, and TargetScan) were employed section to
  predict potential targets of a subset of highly upregulated miRNAs (>2-fold) in
  prostate tumors.  Note that some targeting miRNAs were removed from the original
  publication figure for clarity. These are represented in [supplementary table S3](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1535370216681554).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3982).
