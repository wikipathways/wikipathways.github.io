description: The main ubiquinone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other Saccharomycetes
  species is ubiquinone-6. Biosynthesis of 4-hydroxybenzoate, one of the precursors,
  can occur in yeast by two different paths - it may be produced directly from chorismate
  by the chorismate pyruvate-lyase reaction (similar to the common pathway in prokaryotes),
  or it can be synthesized from L-tyrosine, similar to higher eukaryotes (see 4-hydroxybenzoate
  biosynthesis I (eukaryotes)). At least 10 genes (COQ1-COQ10) have been shown to
  be required for synthesis of ubiquinone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  At least six
  of these proteins (COQ3, COQ4, COQ5, COQ6, COQ7 and COQ9) were shown to form a complex,
  which may be attached to the mitochindria inner membrane by the product of COQ2,
  an integral membrane protein.  Description adapted [yeastgenome.org](from https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/).
