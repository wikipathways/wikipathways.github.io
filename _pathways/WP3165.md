description: Neurotransmitter released in the synaptic cleft binds to specific  receptors
  on the post-synaptic cell and the excess of the neurotransmitter is cleared to prevent
  over activation of the post-synaptic cell. The neurotransmitter is cleared by either
  re-uptake by the pre-synaptic neuron, diffusion in the perisynaptic area, uptake
  by astrocytes surrounding the synaptic cleft or enzymatic degradation of the neurotransmitter.<BR>This
  topic will be annotated in a future release.Original Pathway at [Reactome](http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DB=gk_current&FOCUS_SPECIES_ID=48887&FOCUS_PATHWAY_ID=112311).
