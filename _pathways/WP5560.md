description: Therapeutic approaches in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) increasingly
  focus on modulating B and T cell activity.  B cell–directed therapies involve targeting
  specific surface receptors such as CD19, CD20, CD22, CD38, and CD40, as well as
  blocking B cell-related cytokines like BAFF (B-cell activating factor, also known
  as TNFSF13B).  T cell-focused strategies include blocking co-stimulatory pathways
  (e.g. CD40–CD40L, CD80/86–CD28, ICOS–ICOSL) and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  including IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, and IFN-γ.  Inspired by Figure 1 in [Su et
  al. (2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11522254/).
