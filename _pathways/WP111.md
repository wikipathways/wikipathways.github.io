description: 'An electron transport chain(ETC) couples a chemical reaction between
  an electron donor (such as NADH) and an electron acceptor (such as O₂) to the transfer
  of H⁺ ions across a membrane, through a set of mediating biochemical reactions.
  These H⁺ ions are used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main energy
  intermediate in living organisms, as they move back across the membrane.  In mitochondria,
  it is the conversion of oxygen to water, NADH to NAD+ and succinate to fumarate
  that drives the transfer of H⁺ ions. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transport_chain)  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP111)'
