description: Interleukin-7 (IL-7) was discovered in the year 1988 as a factor that
  enhanced the growth of murine B-cell precursors in bone marrow culture system. It
  was also known as lymphopoietin 1and pre-B cell factor. IL-7 plays an important
  role in the development of B and T cells in mouse and T cells in humans. It is also
  essential for mature and naive T-cell's survival and proliferation.
