description: Inflammation is a protective response of cells to pathogens, infection
  or tissue damage. It involves the coordinated communication of different immune
  cells and blood vessels through an intricate cascade of molecular signals. Inflammation
  can cause fever, cardiovascular pathology, allergy anaphylaxis, fibrosis, autoimmunity,
  etc.
