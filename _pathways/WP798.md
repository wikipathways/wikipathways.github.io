description: The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular
  signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms
  in the Animal kingdom. The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass
  receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged/Serrate families
  of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved,
  but otherwise intact polypeptides.
