  title: An endogenously activated antiviral state restricts SARS-CoV-2 infection
    in differentiated primary airway epithelial cells (2022)
description: The recently identified type III interferon group consists of three IFN-λ
  (lambda) genes encoding molecules called IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2 and IFN-λ3 (also called
  IL29, IL28A and IL28B respectively). These IFNs signal through a receptor complex
  consisting of IL10R2 (also called CRF2-4) and IFNLR1 (also called CRF2-12).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2113
  CPTAC Assay Portal].
