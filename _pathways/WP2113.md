description: The type III interferon group consists of three IFN-λ (lambda) genes
  encoding molecules called IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2 and IFN-λ3 (also called IL29, IL28A and
  IL28B respectively). These IFNs signal through a receptor complex consisting of
  IL10R2 (also called CRF2-4) and IFNLR1 (also called CRF2-12).  Proteins on this
  pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2113).
