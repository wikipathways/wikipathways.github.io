description: In Escherichia coli, division site selection is regulated in part by
  the Min-protein system. Oscillations of the Min proteins from pole to pole every
  approximately 40 sec have been revealed by in vivo studies of GFP fusions. The dynamic
  oscillatory structures produced by the Min proteins, including a ring of MinE protein,
  compact polar zones of MinD, and zebra-striped oscillations in filamentous cells,
  remain unexplained. We show that the Min oscillations, including mutant phenotypes,
  can be accounted for by in vitro-observed interactions involving MinD and MinE,
  with a crucial role played by the rate of nucleotide exchange. Recent discoveries
  suggest that protein oscillations may play a general role in proper chromosome and
  plasmid partitioning. (Huang KC et al. 2003)
