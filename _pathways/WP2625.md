description: Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a cereal species with major economic and
  agricultural impact, is a facultative long-day plant, i.e. it flowers earlier in
  response to long days than to short days. Flowering time genes of the photoperiod,
  vernalization and circadian clock pathways are best studied in barley. The Ppd-H1
  gene, a pseudo-response regulator gene, is thought to be key for flowering induction
  under long days. Further important genes which convey flowering in barley under
  both photoperiods are homologs of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and CONSTANS (CO). Flowering
  in response to vernalization is economically important in temperate cereals like
  barley and wheat and is controlled by the interaction of Vrn-H1 and Vrn-H2.
