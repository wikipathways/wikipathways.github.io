description: HNSCC, which includes malignant squamous lesions arising in the oral
  cavity, larynx and pharynx, is the seventh most common cancer in the world. HNSCC
  has a remarkable multiplicity and diversity of genetic alterations. Most genomic
  alterations in HNSCC converge in a handful of molecular pathways resulting in cell
  cycle deregulation, genomic instability, cell differentiation defects, and persistent
  mitogenic signaling, the latter involving aberrant PI3K/mTOR pathway activation
  thereby rendering HNSCC responsive to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.  Pathway is based on
  [Fig 1 from Iglesias-Bartolome et al](https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4348071),
  [Fig 5 from Li et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14129) and [Fig 33-3
  from Clinicalgate](https://clinicalgate.com/the-molecular-pathogenesis-of-head-and-neck-cancer/).   Description
  is modified from [Iglesias-Bartolome et al](https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4348071).
  Protein phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus
  (R), www.phosphosite.org.
