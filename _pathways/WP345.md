description: 'In eukaryotes the mitochondrial glycine cleavage complex (glycine decarboxylase
  complex) is a loosely-associated multienzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidative
  cleavage of glycine to carbon dioxide, ammonia, and a methylene group, in a multistep
  reaction (in [Nakai05]). The methylene group, carried by 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl
  mono-L-glutamate, enters cellular one-carbon metabolism. In mammals, it is the primary
  pathway for glycine catabolism [Hampson83].  The glycine cleavage complex is composed
  of four different proteins: the P-protein ( EC 1.4.4.2, glycine dehydrogenase (aminomethyl-transferring));
  the T-protein ( EC 2.1.2.10, aminomethyltransferase); the L-protein ( EC 1.8.1.4,
  dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase); and the H-protein (lipoyl-carrier protein, a non-enzyme
  that contains a lipoyl group that interacts successively with the three other components
  of the complex during the enzymatic reactions. The L-protein (also known as the
  E3 component) also participates in the pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl CoA, the
  2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation to succinyl-CoA, and the 2-oxoisovalerate decarboxylation
  to isobutanoyl-CoA multienzyme systems.  Description from [YeastPathways](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/).'
