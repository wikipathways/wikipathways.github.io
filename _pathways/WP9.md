description: 'Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules that consist of a glycerol backbone
  esterified to a phosphate group and two fatty acids. As a primary structural element
  of biological membranes, phospholipids play important roles in cell morphology and
  organelle function. The major phospholipids found in total cell extracts from S.
  cerevisiae are phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol
  (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS); however, the phospholipid composition of yeast
  changes according to the carbon source used for growth. All major phospholipid classes
  in S. cerevisiae may trace their synthesis to a common precursor: cytidine diphosphate
  diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). CDP-DAG is synthesized in a reaction catalyzed by CDP-DAG
  synthase, which converts phosphatidic acid (PA) to CDP-DAG using cytidine triphosphate
  (CTP) as the CDP donor. There are two distinct CDP-DAG synthases in S. cerevisiae:
  Cds1p, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Tam41p, localized in the
  mitochondrial matrix. In the ER, CDP-DAG generated by Cds1p can be converted to
  phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylserine (PS) via PI synthase (Pis1p) or
  PS synthase (Cho1p), respectively. In the mitochondrion, CDP-DAG generated by Tam41p
  can be sequentially converted to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), which can be further
  converted to cardiolipin. Synthesis of PI, PG, and cardiolipin occurs through similar
  mechanisms in mammalian cells; however, unlike yeast, mammals primarily synthesize
  PS from other phospholipids and not from CDP-DAG.  Description adapted from [YeastPathways](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/).'
