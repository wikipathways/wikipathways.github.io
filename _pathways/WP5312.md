description: Fibroblasts are known to contribute to tissue and organ connectivity
  by producing and secreting extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Although several
  diseases, such as fibrosis and cancer, have been linked to changes in fibroblast
  metabolism, the resting metabolic conditions that are present in healthy cells generally
  go unreported. Because fibroblasts are known to display heterogeneity, the metabolic
  processes of different tissues may vary. The aim was to identify and map out the
  general metabolic pathways present in fibroblasts. The pathways for collagen, serine,
  and proline, as well as glycosaminoglycan synthesis, are nearly complete. Nonetheless,
  dashed arrows indicate missing process steps that should be identified and included.
  There is a lack of data on fibroblasts' metabolic activities, and further research
  is required to understand the complete metabolic pathways of fibroblasts.
