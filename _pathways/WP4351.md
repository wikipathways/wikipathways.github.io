description: This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Omega-9 and other fatty acids
  [https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps]. Omega-9 FAs (Fatty acids) are fats
  which can be obtained from diet, but also produced endogenously. These lipids are
  monounsaturated (indicating one double bonds in the lipid tail).The position of
  the double bond is counted from the tail end of the lipid chain. This pathway also
  indicated saturated fats (without a double bond), such as stearic acid, arachidic
  acid etc.
