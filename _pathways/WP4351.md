description: This pathway is inspired by the [Lipidmaps>Omega-9 and other fatty acids](https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps).
  Omega-9 FAs (Fatty acids) are fats which can be obtained from diet, but also produced
  endogenously. These lipids are monounsaturated (indicating one double bonds in the
  lipid tail).The position of the double bond is counted from the tail end of the
  lipid chain. This pathway also indicated saturated fats (without a double bond),
  such as stearic acid, arachidic acid etc.
