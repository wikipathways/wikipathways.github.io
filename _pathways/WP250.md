description: 'The pathway of L-isoleucine biosynthesis from L-threonine is a five-step
  pathway that shares several steps with the pathway of L-valine biosynthesis (see
  [WP2](https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP2.html)). These entwined pathways
  are part of the superpathway of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis, that generates
  not only L-isoleucine and L-valine, but also L-leucine.  Source: [BioCyc](https://biocyc.org/graphics2021/BioCyc.svg)'
