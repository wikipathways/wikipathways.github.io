description: There are several pathways for serine and glycine biosynthesis in S.
  cerevisiae. When glucose is used as the carbon source, glycine can be synthesized
  from threonine via threonine aldolase (Gly1p) in the threonine pathway, while serine
  can be synthesized from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate in the phosphoglycerate
  pathway. Expression of the genes involved in the latter pathway decreases upon depletion
  of glucose. When ethanol or other non-fermentable substrates are used as the carbon
  source, S. cerevisiae can alternatively synthesize glycine from glyoxylate via alanine
  glyoxylate aminotransferase (Agx1p). Glycine and serine produced in these pathways
  can be interconverted to one another via the tetrahydrofolate-dependent serine hydroxymethyltransferases
  Shm1p and Shm2p. Between these, the cytoplasmic isoform Shm2p serves as the major
  source of glycine (via serine breakdown) in serine-rich conditions. The mitochondrial
  isoform Shm1p may also contribute to glycine synthesis, however it preferentially
  catalyzes serine synthesis from glycine under conditions of serine starvation.  Description
