description: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological malignancy and
  the fourth most common malignancy in women in the developed world after breast,
  colorectal and lung cancer. Two types of endometrial carcinoma are distinguished
  with respect to biology and clinical course. Type-I carcinoma is related to hyperestrogenism
  by association with endometrial hyperplasia, frequent expression of estrogen and
  progesterone receptors and younger age, whereas type-II carcinoma is unrelated to
  estrogen, associated with atrophic endometrium, frequent lack of estrogen and progesterone
  receptors and older age. The morphologic differences in these cancers are mirrored
  in their molecular genetic profile with type I showing defects in DNA-mismatch repair
  and mutations in PTEN, K-ras, and beta-catenin, and type II showing aneuploidy,
  p53 mutations, and her2/neu amplification. Phosphorylation information collected
  from PhosphoSitePlus (https://www.phosphosite.org)  Proteins on this pathway have
  targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4155
