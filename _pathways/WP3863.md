description: 'This pathway is based on Figure 4 of "A Model of an Integrated Immune
  System Pathway in Homo sapiens and Its Interaction with Superantigen Producing Expression
  Regulatory Pathway in Staphylococcus aureus: Comparing Behavior of Pathogen Perturbed
  and Unperturbed Pathway"(see bibliography). The pathway displays the T-cell receptors
  of homo sapiens when infected with the disease Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B. The
  binding of a superantigen to the T cell receptor results in a protein signaling
  pathway resulting in cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune response due
  to altered DNA expression. SEB refers to Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B.'
