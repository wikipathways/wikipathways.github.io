description: In addition to being a common source of energy among most organisms,
  glucose is also a precursor to starch and cellulose biosynthesis. The production
  of ADP-, GDP-, and UDP-D-glucose stems from glucose-1-phosphate, which is converted
  from the common glucose derivative, glucose-6-phosphate.
