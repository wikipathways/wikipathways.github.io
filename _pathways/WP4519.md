description: This pathway shows disorders related to the accumulation of organic acids
  in body fluids, resulting in cerebral organic acidurias. Symptoms often include
  mental or motor retardation, difficulties while moving and epilepsy. For all but
  one disorder, current treatment options have been proven ineffective. Disorders
  resulting from an enzyme defect are highlighted in pink. This pathway was inspired
  by Chapter 8 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
