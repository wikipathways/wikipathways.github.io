description: 'The IL-1 family of cytokines currently consists of 11 members which
  are encoded by distinct genes and includes IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², and the IL-1 Receptor
  antagonist (IL-1RA). The major role of IL-1 type cytokines is to control pro-inflammatory
  reactions in response to tissue injury - either due to pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) or Danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Interleukin-1
  (IL-1), which includes IL-1Î± and IL-1Î², plays a crucial role in many auto inflammatory
  diseases. IL- 1Î± and IL-1Î² are produced predominantly by macrophages and monocytes,
  and to a lesser extent by other cell types such as epithelial cells endothelial
  cells and fibroblasts. IL-1 alpha, is a membrane anchored protein which signals
  through autocrine or juxtracrine mechanisms where as the soluble IL-1Î² acts in
  a paracrine or systemic manner. Significant progress has been achieved in the study
  of the signaling events mediated by IL-1 and the processes they control. Involvement
  of IL-1Î± or IL-1Î² in host responses to infections caused by intracellular microorganisms
  such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as in autoinflammatory diseases makes
  its signaling components important candidates for drug targetting for these diseases.
  The two forms of IL-1 (IL-1Î± and IL-1Î²) bind to the same cellular receptor, the
  Type I IL- 1 receptor (IL-1RI) to induce signaling. Upon receptor engagement, IL-1R1
  forms a heterodimer with IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), which functions
  as a co receptor. IL-1RAcP cannot bind directly to IL-1 but is essential for IL-1-mediated
  signaling. Binding of IL-1 to this receptor complex leads to the activation of the
  transcription factor NF-ÎºB through different signaling mechanisms. Two IL-1 receptor-associated
  kinases, IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 have been implicated in the activation of NF-ÎºB. IRAK
  1 and 2 functions as adapter proteins and protein kinases to transmit downstream
  signals. It recruits TRAF6 to the IL-1 receptor complex via an interaction with
  IL-1RAcP. Oligomerization of TRAF6 and subsequent formation of TAK1 and MEKK3 signaling
  complexes relays the signal via NF-ÎºB-inducing kinase (NIK) to two I-kappaB kinases
  (IKK-1 and -2), leading to NF-kappaB activation. Activation of other mitogen activated
  protein kinases, including JNKs and p38 MAPK through various MAP2Ks also play important
  roles in mediating IL-1 responses by activating transcription through the AP-1 transcription
  factor. The above mentioned signaling events co-operatively induce the expression
  of IL-1 target genes such as CCL2, IL-8 and IL-6. The interactions and intersections
  between canonical and non-canonical Interleukin-1 signaling systems are depicted
  in the pathway map. Regulation of IL-1 signaling can be brought about by various
  mechanisms. The IL-1 family member IL-1RA can bind to the IL1-R1 receptor with similar
  affinity as IL-1Î± and Î², but is incapable of activating the signaling response.
  The type II IL-1 receptor can bind to IL-1 alpha and beta but lacks signaling capacity.
  The naturally occurring ''shed'' domains of the extracellular IL-1 receptor chains
  (IL-1RI, IL-1RII and IL- 1RAcP) also act as inhibitors of IL-1 signaling. In the
  cell, IL-1R binds to toll- interacting protein (TOLLIP), which results in the inhibition
  of IRAK1 and by promoting efficient degradation of IL-1R by targeting the internalized
  receptor to endosomes. Other mechanisms such as p38MAPK mediated phosphorylation
  of TAB1 which results in the inactivation of TAK1, and expression of genes including
  MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and Inhibitor of kappa B alpha (NFKBIA) that inhibit
  IL-1 signaling components also serve as negative regulators of IL-1 signaling.  Please
