description: Endochondral ossification is the process by which the embryonic cartilaginous
  model of most bones contributes to longitudinal growth and is gradually replaced
  by bone. During endochondral ossification, chondrocytes proliferate, undergo hypertrophy
  and die; the cartilage extracellular matrix they construct is then invaded by blood
  vessels, osteoclasts, bone marrow cells and osteoblasts, the last of which deposit
  bone on remnants of cartilage matrix. The sequential changes in chondrocyte behaviour
  are tightly regulated by both systemic factors and locally secreted factors, which
  act on receptors to effect intracellular signalling and activation of chondrocyte-selective
  transcription factors. Systemic factors that regulate the behaviour of chondrocytes
  in growth cartilage include growth hormone and thyroid hormone, and the local secreted
  factors include Indian hedgehog, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, fibroblast
  growth factors and components of the cartilage extracellular matrix. Transcription
  factors that play critical roles in regulation of chondrocyte gene expression under
  the control of these extracellular factors include Runx2, Sox9 and MEF2C. The invasion
  of cartilage matrix by the ossification front is dependent on its resorption by
  members of the matrix metalloproteinase family, as well as the presence of blood
  vessels and bone-resorbing osteoclast (Mackie et al.)  Thyroid hormone and especially
  triiodothyronine induce morphological hypertrophy of chondrocytes, through binding
  to thyroid hormone receptors. Further, triiodothyronine increases the total collagen
  production in chondrocytes, as also terminal differentiation, but triiodothyronine
  also induces cell death through non-apoptotic modes of physiological death. Triiodothyronine
  acts by altering intracellular gene expression after receptor binding, and is crucial
  for growth, as receptor deficiencies lead to dwarfism and growth retardation. Thyroid
  hormone inhibits the PTHR1 gene, which encodes for a g-protein coupled receptor
  for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-like hormones. PTH receptors activate adenylyl
  cyclase and a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. They control
  the levels of calcium in the blood and thus, ossification as they inhibit hypertrophy
  upon activation (Mackie, Randau, https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/jansen-type-metaphyseal-chondrodysplasia/
  ). Oxygen acts upon RUNX2 and HDAC4 in the ossification process. HDAC4 is a class
  II histone deacetylase/acuc/apha family gene, and if tethered to a promoter, it
  represses transcription (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9759). Via this mechanism,
  HDAC4 represses RUNX2 in the ossification process. RUNX2 is a member of the RUNX
  family of transcription factors, encoding a nuclear protein with an RUND DNA-binding
  domain. It induces osteoblastic differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis, as it
  acts upon the DNA and regulatory factors (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/860).
  Thus, RUNX2 acts directly upon chondrocytical hypertrophy.  Cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) act upon protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates proteins if activated.
  In this case it leads to the inhibition of Sox9 (https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3314).
  Sox9 induces cell proliferation and inhibits hypertrophy and is regulating the transcription
  of the anti-mÃ¼llerian hormone.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available
  via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP474 CPTAC Assay Portal]
