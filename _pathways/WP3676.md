description: 'Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important neurotrophin
  for the regulation of synaptic activity. BDNF-TrkB signaling, TrkB being the receptor
  of BDNF, is involved in transcription, translation, and trafficking of proteins
  in the various stages of synaptic development and evidence indicates that it also
  plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to strengthen
  or weaken over time. Synaptic plasticity has been associated with learning and memory
  development. These functions are carried out through three pathways: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase CG (PLC/PLCG), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K). Pi3K and MAPK have crucial roles in the protein translation and transport
  caused by synaptic activity. PLCG regulates intracellular levels of Ca²⁺, which
  drives gene transcription through cyclic AMP. Evidence strongly indicates that abnormal
  levels of BDNF leads to significant developmental and neurodegenerative diseases
  by disrupting neural development and function. An understanding of how the BDNF-TrkB
  pathway regulates synaptic activity and plasticity is essential to an understanding
  of how we can effectively treat genetic disruptions of this pathway that lead to
  terrible neurodevelopmental diseases.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays
  available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3676).'
