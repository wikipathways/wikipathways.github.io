description: This pathway describes Vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption from
  the kidney tubules of the nephrons back into the circulation. Vasopressin, antidiuretic
  hormone (ADH), is a peptide hormone produced in neurons of the hypothalamus in response
  to changes in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (hyperosmolality), and
  is secreted into the circulation. When it reaches the kidney, it binds to Vasopressin
  2 receptors, triggering an intracellular signaling cascade that ultimately leads
  to aquaporin 2 (AQP2) vesicles inserted in the apical membrane. This increases the
  water permeability of the membrane. An osmotic gradient then drives water transport
  from the collecting duct through AQP2, and water exits the cell on the basolateral
  side, and back into the circulation.  This description was adapted from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin
  Wikipedia] and [https://www.genome.jp/entry/pathway+map04962 KEGG].  This pathway
  was modeled from [https://www.genome.jp/entry/pathway+map04962 KEGG].
