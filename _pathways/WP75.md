description: 'Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a critical part of the innate immune
  response, and are expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells. TLRs are pattern-recognition
  receptors, and recognize molecules derived from microbes. Once activated, TLRs result
  in activation of innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines
  and upregulation of costimulatory molecules TLR signaling pathways are separated
  into two groups: a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory
  cytokines with quick activation of NFkB and MAPK; and a MyD88-independent pathway
  associated with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation
  of dendritic cells with slow activation of NFkB and MAPK.  Protein phosphorylation
  sites were added based on information from [PhosphoSitePlus (R)](https://www.phosphosite.org).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP75
