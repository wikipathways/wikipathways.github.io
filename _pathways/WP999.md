description: 'The [citric acid cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle),
  also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) or the Krebs cycle, (or rarely,
  the Szent-Gyorgyi-Krebs cycle) is a series of enzyme-catalysed chemical reactions
  of central importance in all living cells that use oxygen as part of cellular respiration.
  In eukaryotes, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion.
  The components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established by seminal
  work from both [Albert Szent-Gyorgyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Szent-Gy%C3%B6rgyi)
  and [Hans Krebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Krebs_(biochemist)).  Source:
