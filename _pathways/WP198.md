description: The biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in S. cerevisiae
  involves a common pathway that metabolizes pyruvate to valine or -ketobutyrate (derived
  from threonine) to isoleucine. This pathway occurs in the mitochondrion until the
  final step, where the immediate precursor to valine or isoleucine is converted to
  its respective amino acid either in the mitochondrion (via Bat1p) or the cytosol
  (via Bat2p). In a branch of the common pathway, valines immediate precursor can
  instead be converted to -isopropylmalate via -isopropylmalate synthase (Leu4p and
  Leu9p), which is subsequently exported to the cytosol and metabolized to leucine
  in three additional steps.
