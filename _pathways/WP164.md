description: Glutathione is a major antioxidant in all forms of life and an indicator
  of cellular oxidative stress. Reduction by the GSR enzyme utilizes NADPH as an electron
  donor. In a reduced form, glutathione is metabolized in multiple ways leading to
  the biosynthesis of mercapturonate, glutamate, glycine, cysteine and other amino
  acids.
