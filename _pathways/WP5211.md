  title: Bioinformatics analysis identifies dysregulation of miR-548F-3p and its hub
    gene in triple-negative breast cancer (2025)
communities: []
description: Glucose metabolism in triple-negative breast cancer cells. The glycolytic
  pathway is significantly upregulated in triple-negative breast tumors. The genes
  coding the key glycolytic enzymes are overexpressed in triple-negative breast tumors.
