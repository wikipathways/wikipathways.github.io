description: 'Flavin-containing monooxygenases are a group of enzymes that catalyze
  the oxygenation of substrates, mostly soft nucleophiles via the cofactor flavin.
  In the catalytic cycle, FMO binds to NADPH and to FAD, causing the reduction of
  FAD to FADH2. Next, molecular oxygen binds to the complex and is reduced to a hydroperoxide
  form, called 4a-hydroperoxyflavin. This complex is stable in the absence of a substrate.
  When a substrate is present, the distal O-atom of the complex is transferred to
  the substrate yielding an oxygenated product and leaving the flavincomplex 4a-hydroxyflavin
  that breaks down releasing water. At the end of the cycle, NADP+ is released resulting
  in FAD as the flavin form to start a next cycle.   In contrast to cytochrome P450
  enzymes, FMOs are generally not induced or inhibited by xenobiotic substances. The
  five human FMOs are tissue specific: FMO1 is present in the human fetal liver and
  the adult kidney, FMO2 is present in the lung and FMO3 is present in the adult liver.'
