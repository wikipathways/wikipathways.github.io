description: 'This pathway describes the sex determination in a fetus.  For the male
  development the SRY gene plays an important role, leading to the SOX9 expression
  which will then stimulate AMH expression and testis development. In adults DMRT1
  and SOX9 inhibit the FOXL2 gene, maintaining the male sex determination.  For the
  female development the WNT4 and RSPO1 signaling pathways lead to beta-catenin accumulation
  which inhibits SOX9 and the development of ovaries. In adults, Foxl2 repress Sox9
  expression to maintain ovarian identity. '
