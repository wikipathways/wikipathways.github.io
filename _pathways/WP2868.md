description: Schematic showing the shift in nutrient utilization in TCA cycle with
  increasing degree of invasiveness. Low-invasive ovarian cancer (OVCA) cells are
  glucose dependent for their TCA cycle pool. With increasing invasiveness in cancer
  cells, dominant nutrient which feeds the TCA cycle shifts from glucose to Gln. In
  high-invasive OVCA cells, Gln dominates the TCA cycle. In low-invasive OVCA cells,
  glucose activates Jak1, which activates STAT3 by tyrosine phosphorylation, thereby
  regulating glycolysis in cancer cells. In highinvasive OVCA cells, besides glucose's
  role in activating STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, glutamine activates JAK1 through
  TCA cycle to further activate STAT3 by tyrosine phosphorylation and thus regulate
  glycolysis. Further, Gln activates Erk1/2, which subsequently activates STAT3 by
  serine phosphorylation selectively in high-invasive OVCA cells. The serine phosphorylation
  of STAT3 enhances oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria by interaction with
  mitochondrial complexes I and II, thereby increasing TCA cycle activity in high-invasive
  OVCA cells.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2868
