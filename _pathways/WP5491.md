description: '"Model for signaling pathways and transcription factors that regulate
  B cell commitment to the germinal center (GC) fate. Boxes that indicate signaling
  molecules are colored yellow, transcription regulators red, downstream gene targets
  turquoise and epigenetic modifiers purple.   The B cell receptor (BCR), via its
  signaling subunits Igα and Igβ as well as downstream tyrosine kinases such as SYK
  and LYN, activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. MAPK signaling induces the expression of the transcriptional
  activator myocyte enhancer binding factor 2c (MEF2C), which promotes the transcription
  of B cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl2l1) and cyclin D2 (Ccnd2). The expression of
  the transcriptional repressor inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (ID3) is reduced following
  B cell activation, allowing for transcription factor 3/4 (TCF3/4)-driven induction
  of Icosl and Mef2b transcription.   PI3K/AKT and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling
  also induce the expression of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor
  4 (IRF4). IRF4 and TCF3/4 induce the expression of the co-activator OBF1 (also known
  as POU class 2 homeobox associating factor 1 (POU2AF1)), which cooperates with OCT2
  (also known as POU class 2 homeobox 2 (POU2F2)) to promote transcription of Slamf1,
  Syk and Il6. OBF1 and OCT2 can also induce the expression of the transcription factor
  SPI-B, which acts in a redundant fashion with PU.1 to enhance the transcription
  of genes encoding B cell surface receptors, such as Cd40, B cell activating factor
  receptor (Baffr), Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) and Tlr9, and many components of the
  BCR signaling pathway, including Blnk and Btk.   Although transiently elevated levels
  of IRF4 can induce the expression of B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6), sustained IRF4 levels
  will repress BCL-6 expression. BCL-6 expression is also induced by the transcription
  factors MEF2B and IRF8/PU.1 as well as the cytokines IL-4 and IL-21, which bind
  to their respective receptors (IL-4R and IL-21R) and induce signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 6 (STAT6)/STAT3 signaling. CD40 and/or TLR-driven NF-κB
  signaling, alongside PI3K/AKT signaling, will induce the expression of the transcription
  factor MYC, which promotes cellular proliferation by inducing the transcription
  of Ccnd2/Ccnd3 and the expression of the transcription factor E2F transcription
  factor 1 (E2F1). E2F1 induces expression of Ezh2 that encodes a Polycomb repressive
  complex 2 (PRC2) enzymatic component. Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) promotes
  cell cycle progression by repressing the expression of Cdkn1a, Cdkn2a and Cdkn1b,
  which encode cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. EZH2 also promotes E2F1 release
  from the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein via phosphorylation of Rb, thereby enhancing
  E2F1 activation and further EZH2 expression. BCL-6 can directly repress MYC expression,
  thereby limiting the number of cell divisions that GC B cells undergo. BCL-6 promotes
  GC B cell development through regulation of numerous genes controlling cellular
  processes including the DNA damage response, B cell migration, apoptosis, BCR and
  CD40 signaling, plasma cell differentiation and T cell:B cell interactions. Together,
  these transcriptional regulators allow for the precise control of GC initiation
  that is necessary to balance the competing needs of the immune system to induce
  a protective response while limiting immunopathology."  Derived from https://pfocr.wikipathways.org/figures/PMC7538181__41577_2020_446_Fig1_HTML.html'
