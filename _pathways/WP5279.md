description: Mineralocorticoid synthesis and metabolism, which produce adrenal steroid
  hormones from cholesterol. These hromones regulate sodium retention in the kidneys
  and are therefore essential in sodium balance, intravascular volume, and blood pressure
  [PMID:8839934].  The pathway knowledge depicted in this model stems from William
  Griffths.  Metabolic reactions currently without a Rhea ID have been added in bold
  to the pathway model.
