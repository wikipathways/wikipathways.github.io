description: 'Vitamin K is recycled in the liver in order to maintain sufficient levels
  for activating vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDP), including certain coagulation
  factors. In this process, vitamin K1 (taken up from the diet) is converted to vitamin
  K hydroquinone (KH2), either by the dithiol-dependent vitamin K-epoxide reductase
  (VKOR) or by NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1. KH2 is in turn oxidized to vitamin
  K epoxide (KO) by the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX). During this conversion,
  GGCX activates the VKDPs by converting glutamate (Glu) to gamma-carboxyglutamate
  (Gla). Lastly, KO is converted back into vitamin K quinone by VKOR.   Warfarin,
  a drug commonly used as a anticoagulant, inhibits VKOR, thus reducing the levels
  of VKH2 in the bloodstream. A too high dosage of warfarin can lead to heavy bleeding,
  a life-threatening condition. Threatment of this condition is a high dosis of Vitamine
  K, which is reduced to VHK2 by FSP1, a warfarin resistant reductase. The influence
  of FSP1 on this process, as well as its potential to eliminate lipid perozyl radicals,
  has been recently described in [Nature (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05022-3)
  by Mishima et al.: A non-canonical vitamin K cycle is a potent ferroptosis suppressor.   '
