description: 'Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly malignant cancer of the
  lung.  Genes altered in small cell lung carcinoma: 1. TP53 is mutated in 70-90%
  of SCLCs.  2. RB1 is inactivated in most SCLCs.  3. PTEN is mutated in 2-10% of
  SCLCs.  4. MYC amplifications and amplification of MYC family members is found in
  30% of SCLCs.  5. FHIT protein expression is lost due to loss of heterozygocity
  (LOH) on chromosome arm 3p found in more than 80% of SCLCs.   This description was
  adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-cell_carcinoma).  Phosphorylation
  sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.'
