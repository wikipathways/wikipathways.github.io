description: 'Purine and pyrimidine nucleotides have many diverse and essential roles
  in the cell. They are precursors to DNA, RNA, and many important metabolites (for
  example CDP-diacylglycerol). Nucleotides can also be used as an energy source (primarily
  as ATP), signaling molecules, and cofactor components (for example coenzyme A).
  In yeast, the initial steps of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis are catalyzed by
  the bifunctional carbamoylphosphate synthetase/aspartate transcarbamylase Ura2p.
  In the first step, Ura2p catalyzes the synthesis of carbamoylphosphate from CO2,
  ATP, and glutamine. In the second, Ura2p condenses carbamoylphosphate with aspartate
  to yield ureidosuccinate/carbamoyl-L-aspartate. Third, dihydroorotase (Ura4p) catalyzes
  closure of the pyrimidine ring of ureidosuccinate to form dihydroorotate (DHO).
  DHO, in turn, is oxidized to orotic acid (OA), condensed with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate
  to form orotidine 5-monophosphate, and finally decarboxylated to yield UMP. These
  three steps are catalyzed by Ura1p, Ura5p/Ura10p, and Ura3p, respectively. UMP may
  then undergo further processing to form other pyrimidines.  Source: [yeastgenome.org](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/)'
