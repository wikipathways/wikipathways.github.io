description: The short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) acetate, propionate and butyrate can
  alter skeletal muscle metabolism both via direct and indirect mechanisms. Indirect
  mechanisms include the stimulation of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide
  YY (PYY) release via G-protein coupled receptor 41 (GPR41) and GPR43 signalling.
  Increased peripheral levels of these gut-derived satiety hormones induce the recruitment
  of microvasculature in skeletal muscle tissue and thereby contribute to improved
  insulin signalling. Furthermore SCFA induce a reduction in lipolysis in white adipose
  tissue (WAT), resulting in enhanced WAT lipid buffering capacity and decreased levels
  ectopic fat accumulation in skeletal muscle tissue.   SCFA are also suggested to
  have direct effects on skeletal muscle metabolism, possibly via GPR41 and GPR43
  signalling. SCFA  induce the activation of  adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK), a key regulator in skeletal muscle cell metabolism. Activated AMPK
  induces several metabolic pathways including fatty acid oxidation and the synthesis
  of glycogen. Active AMPK also stimulates glucose uptake via translocation of glucose
  transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and decreases glycolysis. In addition to AMPK activation,
  SCFA might also induce peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARD)
  expression, another process contributing to enhanced fat oxidation levels.
