description: The signaling pathways involved in eyelid development are displayed with
  interactions that are known (solid arrows) and proposed (dotted arrows). The four
  main pathways shown are activated by Fgf10 and regulate key processes, but also
  interact with each other. The first pathway is a proposed promotion of sfrp1 which
  inhibits Wnt that regulates the Meibomian Gland. The Wnt pathway also activates
  pitx2 and begins the proposed pathway to eyelid closure. The second pathway begins
  with Fgfr2 activating Bmp4, a protein that may also be regulated by Shh, and continuing
  through a protein chain to regulate conjunctival cell fate. In this pathway Bmp
  also inhibits transdifferentiation of Meibomian Gland into a hair follicle, conjunctiva
  proliferation, and precocious differentiation. The last two pathways are linked
  to the regulation of eyelid closure through a cascade of protein activation and
  is further promoted by Bmp through stimulation of phosphorylated c-Jun. This pathway
  is based on figure 10B from Huang et al.
