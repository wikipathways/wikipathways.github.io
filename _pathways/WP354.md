description: 'While Saccharomyces cerevisiae can use most amino acids as their sole
  nitrogen source, they can only use a few amino acids as a carbon source to support
  growth (CITS:[Large86][Cooper82]).  This is in contrast to most eukaryotes and some
  fungi, which can metabolize amino acids completely, utilizing them as sole sources
  of carbon and nitrogen (CITS:[Stryer88][Large 86]). S. cerevisiae degrade the branched-chain
  amino acids (leucine, iso-leucine, and valine) and the aromatic amino acids (tryptophan,
  phenylalanine, and tyrosine) via the Ehrlich pathway (CITS:[Sentheshanmuganathan60][10989420]).  This
  pathway is comprised of the following steps:  1) deamination of the amino acid to
  the corresponding alpha-keto acid; 2) decarboxylation of the resulting alpha-keto
  acid to the respective aldehyde; and, 3) reduction of the aldehyde to form the corresponding
  long chain or complex alcohol, known as a fusel alcohol or fusel oil (CITS:[10989420][Large
  86]).  Fusel alcohols are important flavor and aroma compounds in yeast-fermented
  food products and beverages (as reported in (CITS:[9546164]).  Each of the three
  steps in branched-chain amino acid degradation can be catalyzed by more than one
  isozyme; which enzyme is used appears to depend on the amino acid, the carbon source
  and the stage of growth of the culture (CITS:[12499363]). In leucine degradation,
  Thi3p is believed to be the major decarboxylase (CITS: [12499363]).  SOURCE: [SGD
