description: 'In fission yeast, the rad3 gene product plays a critical role in sensing
  DNA structure defects and activating damage response pathways. A structural homologue
  of rad3 in humans has been identified based on sequence similarity in the protein
  kinase domain.  ATR (for Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related) is considered the
  mammalian counterpart of yeast rad3, Mec1p, and fruit fly Mei-41, proteins involved
  in DNA damage responses. The ATR protein is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  related kinase family and plays an important role in UV-induced DNA damage checkpoint
  response and its role as a signal transducer in cell cycle checkpoint has been well
  established.  Even though it is currently unclear whether ATR functions as a damage
  sensor, recent evidence shows that ATR may function as an initial sensor in the
  DNA damage checkpoint response.  Moreover, it has been found that ATR is a DNA-binding
  protein with higher affinity to UV-damaged than undamaged DNA.  In addition, damaged
  DNA stimulates the kinase activity of ATR to a significantly higher level than undamaged
  DNA. ATR is structurally related to ATM (for Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) as well
  as the yeast PIK family members Mec1p and Rad3.  Mec1p and Rad3 participate in checkpoint
  pathways induced by DNA replication blocks, DNA strand breaks, and other chromosomal
  abnormalities, which implies that ATR performs similar functions in mammalian cells.  Reports
  have demonstrated that overexpression of a catalytically inactive version of ATR
  (ATRki) in human fibroblasts caused hypersensitivity to gamma-radiation and hydroxyurea
  and abrogation of the radiation-induced G2 checkpoint.  The checkpoint defects observed
  in ATR-overexpressing cells resemble those found in AT cells. Additionally, ATR
  functions as an upstream regulator of p53 phosphorylation in DNA-damaged cells.  ATR
  phosphorylates p53 at both Ser-15 and Ser-37 in vitro, suggesting that ATR is directly
  involved in the modification of p53 in DNA-damaged cells.  Recent reports concerning
  ATM, suggest that ATR and ATM play both overlapping and independent roles in the
  phosphorylation of p53 during cellular exposure to genotoxic stress. Atr is localized
  to the nuclei of primary spermatocytes, cells that are undergoing meiosis I.  It
  has been demonstrated that both Atr and Atm proteins have associated protein kinase
  activity, consistent with their primary structures.  Additionally, Atr and Atm show
  specific association with chromosomes in cells that are in early meiosis I as demonstrated
  by antibody localization on surface-spread spermatocytes.  Both the Atr and Atm
  proteins are present at pairing forks in meiotic prophase as chromosomes synapse;
  however, they do not colocalize, instead they occupy complementary positions: Atr
  localizes along unsynapsed chromosome axes and Atm interacts with synapsed axes.
  Meanwhile ATM is activated by damage-induced rapid intermolecular autophosphorylation
  prior relocalization to sites of DNA breaks, ATR activation seems to require single-stranded
  DNA (ssDNA) coated with replication protein A.  The recruitment of ATR to damage
  sites appears to be mediated by an ATR-interacting protein that forms a stable complex
  with the vast majority of ATR in human cells.'
