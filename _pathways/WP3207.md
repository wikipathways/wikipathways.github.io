description: Glutathione is a major antioxidant in all forms of life and an indicator
  of cellular oxidative stress. Reduction by the GSR enzyme utilizes NADPH as an electron
  donor. In a reduced form, glutathione is metabolized in multiple ways leading to
  the biosynthesis of mercapturonate, glutamate, glycine, cysteine and other amino
  acids.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay
  Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP100)
