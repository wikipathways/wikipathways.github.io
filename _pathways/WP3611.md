description: Photodynamic therapy may induce an acute stress response mediated by
  mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 5 (MAP3K5), its downstream MAPKs
  that target c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK, MAPK8) and p38MAPK, and the transcription
  factors of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family.
