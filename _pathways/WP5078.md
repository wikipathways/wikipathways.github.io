description: Pancreatic cancer cells create a microenvironment by secreting cytokines
  and chemokines that recruit or activate stromal cells.  This promotes desmoplasia
  -- an accumulation of extracellular matrix that contributes to fibrosis -- and immune
  evasion. Key players include myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs).
  PSCs are the main source of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and the TAM-PSC
  interaction enhances desmoplasia. These stromal cells help cancer cells evade immune
  surveillance by inhibiting CD8+ T cells through factors like IL-10, TGFβ, PD-L1,
  and IDO.
