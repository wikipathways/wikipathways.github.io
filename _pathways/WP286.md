description: 'Interleukin 3 (IL-3) is a potent growth factor belonging to the super
  family of cytokines. IL-3 is a 20- 32kDa glycoprotein involved in the process of
  hematopoiesis. It is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of pleuripotent
  hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells and their mature progeny. IL-3 is a growth
  factor for B lymphocytes. It also activates monocytes and augments survival and
  propagation of mast cells, eosinophils and stromal cells. IL-3 is secreted predominantly
  by activated T lymphocytes in response to immunological stimuli and to a lesser
  extent by mast cells and eosinophils. IL-3 exerts influence on different biological
  activities, primarily hematopoiesis by associating with the IL-3 receptor. This
  receptor is a heterodimeric complex and consists of an alpha chain- IL3RA and a
  beta chain CSF2RB, shared with the receptors for granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating
  factor and Interleukin-5. When IL-3 binds to CSF2RB receptor, adapter proteins like
  SHC1, GRB2 and SOS1 are recruited to activate HRAS. HRAS stimulates RAF1 which further
  activates MAP2K1 and finally MAPK1 and MAPK3. The signals generated through this
  pathway are then transmitted to the nucleus leading to the activation of various
  transcription factors such as JUN and FOS which are involved in the regulation of
  cell growth and differentiation. IL-3 mediated activation of HRAS also inhibits
  apoptosis through phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase/ AKT pathway. The activation of
  AKT1 in response to IL-3 stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of the apoptotic
  regulator, BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), its binding to 14-3-3 and
  sequestration into the cytoplasm. IL-3 stimulation activates Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)
  by its phosphorylation. JAK2 in turn phosphorylates signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 5A and 5B. These translocate to the nucleus, serving the purpose
  of transcription factor for early genes as well as a feedback inhibitor of the JAK-STAT
  pathway. IL-3, in addition, is known to activate various tyrosine kinases such as
  LYN, FYN, SRC, SYK, TEC1 and HCK. The interactions and intersections between canonical
  and noncanonical IL-3 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map.   Please
