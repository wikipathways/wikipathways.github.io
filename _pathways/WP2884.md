description: NRF2 is part of a group of transcription factors called nuclear receptors.
  It is activated under oxidative stress conditions and subsequently activates several
  antioxidative genes and proteins.    Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays
  available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2884).
