description: 'Fatty Acids (FAs) consists of several chain lengths (short, medium and
  long chain), which all need to be converted to CoA-bound esters to cross the inner
  mitochondrial membrane. The long-chain lengths however also need additional carnitine
  esterification.  Several diseases are linked to the proteins in this pathway, which
  can be categorized into four groups: 1. entry of long-chain FAs into mitochondria
  disorders; 2. intra-mitochondrial beta-oxidation membrane-bound proteins defects
  involving long-chain FAs; 3. intra-mitochondrial beta-oxidation matrix proteins
  defects involving short and medium-chain FAs; 4. impaired electron transfer to Oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system.   This pathway has been inspired by Chapter 17
  of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)), edition 4 and build on top
  of the original  [https://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP368_r117795 ''Mitochondrial
  long chain fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway''].  Proteins on this pathway have
  targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP368
