description: The cell cycle is the series of events that takes place in a cell leading
  to its division and duplication (replication). Regulation of the cell cycle involves
  processes crucial to the survival of a cell, including the detection and repair
  of genetic damage as well as the prevention of uncontrolled cell division. Two key
  classes of regulatory molecules, cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), determine
  a cell's progress through the cell cycle. Adapted from [KEGG](http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway/sce/sce04110.html)  Description
