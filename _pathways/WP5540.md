description: This diagram shows the immunopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS)
  and therapeutic targets.  Available therapies for MS act through a range of mechanisms,
  including pleiotropic effects, immune cell depletion, inhibition of proliferation,
  and blockade of cell migration.  These intervene at various stages of the inflammatory
  process.   Treatments exert their effects across the peripheral immune system, the
  blood–brain barrier, and within the central nervous system (CNS) itself.  Inspired
  by Figure 1 in [Bierhansl et al. (2022)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9169033/).
