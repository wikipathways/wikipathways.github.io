description: Post-COVID is the sequela disease of COVID-19, a SARS-CoV-2 infectious
  disease that is characterized by long-term persistent symptoms. To understand the
  underlying disease mechanisms of post-COVID and the role of persistent neuroinflammation
  herein, this pathway visualizes the direct and indirect route of SARS-CoV-2-mediated
  neuroinflammation, which may induce dysautonomia, a major post-COVID symptom. The
  direct and indirect route are subdivided in a neurological and hematological, and
  a neurological and humoral route, respectively.
