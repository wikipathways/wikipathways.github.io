description: A germline variant, rs351855-G/A, in FGFR (c.1162G>A, p.Gly388Arg), activates
  the proximal STAT3 signaling pathway. This germline receptor variant, FGFR p.Gly388Arg,
  recruits STAT3 to inner cell membranes, resulting in increased levels of STAT3 tyrosine
  phosphorylation. This heritable variant-specific signaling pathway enhances both
  tumor-intrinsic proliferation and tumor-extrinsic immune evasion within the tumor
  microenvironment. The tumor-intrinsic molecular function is driven by elevated levels
  of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 in tumor cells, promoting cell division and enhancing
  proliferation. Meanwhile, the tumor-extrinsic molecular function is influenced by
  increased levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 in regulatory T cells and CD8
  T cells. This activates the STAT3 signaling pathway predominantly in Tregs and alters
  the Treg/CD8 T cell ratio in lymphoid organs, thereby limiting immune surveillance
  within the tumor microenvironment.
