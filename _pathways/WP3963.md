description: The mevalonate pathway, also known as the isoprenoid pathway or HMG-CoA
  reductase pathway is an essential metabolic pathway present in eukaryotes, archaea,
  and some bacteria. The pathway produces two five-carbon building blocks called isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which are used to make
  isoprenoids, a diverse class of over 30,000 biomolecules such as cholesterol, vitamin
  K, coenzyme Q10, and all steroid hormones. (Wikipedia)
