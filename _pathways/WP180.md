description: 'The biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in S. cerevisiae
  involves a common pathway that metabolizes pyruvate to valine or -ketobutyrate (derived
  from threonine) to isoleucine. This pathway occurs in the mitochondrion until the
  final step, where the immediate precursor to valine or isoleucine is converted to
  its respective amino acid either in the mitochondrion (via Bat1p) or the cytosol
  (via Bat2p). In a branch of the common pathway, valines immediate precursor can
  instead be converted to -isopropylmalate via -isopropylmalate synthase (Leu4p and
  Leu9p), which is subsequently exported to the cytosol and metabolized to leucine
  in three additional steps.  Many genes in the common pathway of BCAA biosynthesis
  are induced by Gcn4 in response to starvation for any amino acid. Additionally,
  the flow of substrates into valine, isoleucine, or leucine biosynthesis is controlled
  depending on the concentration of each of the three amino acids. Threonine deaminase
  (Ilv1p), which converts threonine to -ketobutyrate for isoleucine biosynthesis,
  is inhibited by high concentrations of isoleucine. This inhibition is reversed by
  valine; however, high concentrations of both isoleucine and valine will also result
  in inhibition. Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS; Ilv2p), which catalyzes the first
  step in the common pathway of BCAA biosynthesis, is subject to feedback inhibition
  by valine. Likewise, -isopropylmalate synthase (Leu4p and Leu9p) is also feedback
  inhibited by its end product, leucine.  Description from YeastPathways superpathway
