description: GABP alpha/beta complex mediates the maintenance of hematopoietic stem
  cells (HSCs) through control of proteins necessary for epigenetic modification and
  transcription regulation. The activation of key transcription factors and proteins
  required for HSC survival, self renewal, quiescence, differentiation, and aging
  is controlled by the GABP alpha/beta complex. This complex also down-regulates GZMB,
  protein important for inhibiting HSC survival. This pathway is based on figure 7
  from Yu et al.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the
  [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3657).
