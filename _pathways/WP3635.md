description: The paper describes insulin signaling in human adipocytes under normal
  and diabetic states using mathematical models based on experimental data. This model
  corresponds to insulin signaling under diabetic condition. Insulin signaling under
  normal condition is represented in WP3634. The model has been converted to GPML
  using the PathSBML plugin from PathVisio, importing the model BIOMD0000000449 from
  the BioModels Database directly. The layout has been improved manually.
