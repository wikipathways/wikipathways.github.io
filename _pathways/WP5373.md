description: Hypoxia in osteoarthritis (OA) leads to low oxygen levels in cartilage,
  activating hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Angiogenesis occurs in response to
  hypoxia, stimulating the formation of new blood vessels. Vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF) plays a key role in angiogenesis. Dysregulation of the canonical FGF
  signalling pathway disrupts chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. In OA,
  aberrant FGF signalling contributes to the hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype. This
  phenotype is associated with increased cell size, altered gene expression and matrix
  degradation. Understanding these interactions may provide therapeutic insights for
  the treatment of OA. The pathway is based on Figure 5 of the paper by Ellen G. J.
  Ripmeester et al. (2018).
