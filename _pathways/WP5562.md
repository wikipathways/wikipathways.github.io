description: 'In celiac disease, gluten peptides breach the intestinal epithelial
  barrier and are deamidated by tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2). These modified peptides
  are presented on HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules by antigen-presenting cells (APCs),
  leading to the activation of gluten-specific CD4⁺ T cells. Once activated, these
  T cells produce inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-21, and TNF-α, which
  contribute to small-intestinal mucosal damage, in part by acting alongside IL-15
  secreted by inflamed epithelial cells.  Intraepithelial cytotoxic CD8⁺ T cells are
  also activated, releasing granzyme B (GZMB) and IFN-γ, amplifying the cycle of inflammation.
  In the periphery, gluten-specific memory CD4⁺ T cells remain vigilant and rapidly
  respond to gluten exposure—within 6 hours—by releasing inflammatory mediators like
  IL-2.  Emerging evidence suggests that bacterial or viral infections may disrupt
  oral tolerance to gluten. Current therapeutic approaches under investigation target
  multiple stages of CeD pathogenesis:  * Glutenases and anti-gliadin antibody AGY
  degrade or neutralize gluten;  * Integrin antagonists and tight junction modulators
  aim to restore epithelial barrier integrity;  * TG2 inhibitors block gluten peptide
  deamidation;  * Anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suppress IL-15–driven inflammation;  *
  CD4⁺ T cell–targeted therapies seek to inhibit the expansion of pathogenic gluten-specific
  T cells;  * Tolerance-inducing strategies aim to delete or anergize gluten-specific
  CD4⁺ T cells or promote their differentiation into regulatory T cells (Tregs).'
