description: 'In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase, and therefore the initiation of transcription,
  requires the presence of a core promoter sequence in the DNA. RNA polymerase is
  able to bind to core promoters in the presence of various specific transcription
  factors. The most common type of core promoter in eukaryotes is a short DNA sequence
  known as a TATA box. The TATA box, as a core promoter, is the binding site for a
  transcription factor known as TATA binding protein (TBP), which is itself a subunit
  of another transcription factor, called Transcription Factor II D (TFIID). After
  TFIID binds to the TATA box via the TBP, five more transcription factors and RNA
  polymerase combine around the TATA box in a series of stages to form a preinitiation
  complex. One transcription factor, DNA helicase, has helicase activity and so is
  involved in the separating of opposing strands of double-stranded DNA to provide
  access to a single-stranded DNA template. However, only a low, or basal, rate of
  transcription is driven by the preinitiation complex alone. Other proteins known
  as activators and repressors, along with any associated coactivators or corepressors,
  are responsible for modulating transcription rate.  Source: [[wikipedia:Transcription_(genetics)|Wikipedia]]'
