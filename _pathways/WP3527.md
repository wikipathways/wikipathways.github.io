description: 'The source of this pathway is RNA-Seq data from single-cell pre-implantation
  embryos, Supplemental Table 1 from [http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v20/n9/full/nsmb.2660.html
  Yan et al.]  Analysis options for running the single-cell analysis workflow in AltAnalyze
  (ICGS): * For optimal filtering (not too restrictive), change the Fold change filter
  cutoff from 10 to 100 and the Minimum number of samples differing from 3 to 2. *
  Change the Select the column clustering method to hopach. * The final ICGS cell
  cluster groups (hopach) were further analyzed to identify genes with restricted
  expression in one of the identified sub-populations using the MarkerFinder algorithm
  in AltAnalyze (RPKM>1).  * MarkerFinder identified genes for each sub-population
  (e.g., 8-cell pattern 1) were further filtered for DNA-binding and RNA-binding factors,
  that are reported in this pathway.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays
