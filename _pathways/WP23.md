description: 'The functional B-cell receptor is a multi-protein complex consisting
  of an antigen binding subunit and a signaling subunit. The antigen binding subunit
  is the membrane bound immunoglobulin and the signaling subunit consists of the IgÎ±
  and IgÎ² proteins, which are covalently bound to each other. Both IgÎ± and IgÎ²
  proteins have an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based activation motif (ITAM) each in
  its cytoplasmic region, which is responsible for the initiation and propagation
  of signaling. Antigen binding to the immunoglubulin results in the aggregation of
  both the immunoglobulin and the IgÎ±/Î² subunits. This results in the phosphorylation
  of the tyrosine residues in the ITAM motif of the IgÎ±/Î² subunits by the src-family
  of protein tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. The Src family kinases are initially in
  the proximity of the BCR as a result of membrane anchoring by virtue of its their
  acetylation. The N-terminal region of the kinases can also interact with the non-phosphorylated
  ITAMs of IgÎ±. This association is further enhanced upon BCR engagement as a result
  of accumulation in BCR containing lipid rafts and SH2 domain mediated binding to
  the phosphorylated tyrosine residues in ITAMs. This increased association helps
  in amplifying the BCR mediated signaling. Doubly phosphorylated IgÎ±/Î² ITAMs are
  necessary for efficient recruitment of Syk and its activation. Activated Syk then
  phsophorylates the adapter molecule B cell linker protein (BLNK), which acts as
  molecular scaffold for the recruitment of multiple effectors and hence the propagation
  of multiple signaling pathways. BLNK binds to Btk and PLCÎ³2 which results in optimal
  phosphorylation and activation of PLC. This is an important mechanism which links
  BCR to Ca2+ signaling. Apart from the PLC mediated Ca2+ signaling, BCR triggering
  also results in the the activaion of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K). This
  activation takes place through the recruitment of p85 adaptor subunit of PI-3K to
  CD19 co-receptor, which is phosphorylated by Lyn on its cytoplasmic Y-X-X-M motif.
  Alternatively, PI-3K can be recruited to the plasma membrane by other adapter molecules
  including PIK3AP, CBL or GAB1/2. PI-3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidyl inositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate. Akt, a serine threonine
  kinase, is recruited to the plasma membrane by virtue of its N-terminal PH-domain
  where it is activated by conformational changes and phosphorylation. Activated Akt
  phosphorylates several substrates resulting in diverse physiological consequences:
  Forkhead transcription factors - resulting in its degradation and hence inhibition
  of expression of pro-apoptotic genes, glycogen synthase kinase-3 GSK3 -leading to
  its inhibition and hence regulation of cell-cycle. The tanscription factor NF-kappaB
  is also found to be activated in BCR signaling in a Btk, PI-3K and PKC dependent
  manner.  BCR engagement can also result in the association of GRB2/SOS complex with
  either SHC or BLNK, which results in the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling
  cascade. This cascade leads to the activation of transcription factors including
  ELK and MYC. BCR activation also results in the activation of JNKs and p38MAPK.   Please
