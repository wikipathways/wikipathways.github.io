description: 'The pentose phosphate pathway is important for generating NADPH, which
  is a source of reducing energy, as well as a variety of sugar molecules that are
  required for the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and  amino acids. This pathway is
  also important for protecting yeast from oxidative  stress, since NADPH is an essential
  cofactor for glutathione- and thioredoxin-dependent enzymes that defend cells against
  oxidative damage. The pentose phosphate pathway is of industrial interest for the
  fermentation of xylose to ethanol. Xylose is the predominant sugar found in biomass
  such as agricultural wastes, wood, municipal solid wastes, and wastes from pulp
  and paper industries, and possibly could serve as a low-cost and abundant raw material
  for  fuel ethanol production. Saccharomyces cerevisiae does  not naturally metabolize
  xylose, but recombinant S. cerevisiae strains containing the xylose reductase and
  xylitol dehydrogenase  genes from Pichia stipitis are able to metabolize xylose
  via the  pentose phosphate pathway. Changes in the levels of enzymes in the pentose
  phosphate pathway effect the fitness, ethanol production, and amount of xylose metabolized
  by these recombinant xylose-utilizing strains. The pentose phosphate pathway is
  also of medical interest because mutations in the human homologs of some yeast pentose
  phosphate genes  are associated with a variety of diseases. Zwf1p is homologus to
  human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which has been  implicated in neonatal
  jaundice and haemolytic anemia. Sol3p and Sol4p have similarity to human PGLS, which
  is associated with 6- phosphogluconolactonase deficiency and may contribute to some
  forms  of G6PD-associated hemolytic anemia. Sol3p and Sol4p  also have similarity
  to human H6PD, which is associated with  cortisone reductase deficiency. Gnd1p and
  Gnd2p have  similarity to human PGD, mutation in which may also contribute to  some
  forms of G6PD-associated hemolytic anemia. Tal1p  is similar to human TALDO1, mutation
  in which has been reported to be associated with transaldolase deficiency and hepatosplenomegaly.
  Rki1p has similarity to human RPIA, which has been associated with ribose 5-phosphate
  isomerase deficiency, leukoencephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy.    TKL1, TKL2,
  Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, Fructose-6-phosphate, and Xylulose-5-phosphate are duplicated
  for clarity, but are part of the same cytoplasmic pool.  Net Reaction Equation:
  3 glucose 6-P + 6 NADP+ + 3H2O = 6 NADPH + 6 H+ + 3 CO2 + glyceraldehyde 3-P + 2
