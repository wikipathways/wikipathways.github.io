description: 'The G13 subunit is an alpha unit of heterotrimeric G proteins that regulates
  cell processes through the use of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. G13 regulates
  actin cytoskeletal remodeling in cells and is essential for receptor tyrosine kinase-induced
  migration of fibroblast and endothelial cells.  Source: [[wikipedia:G12/G13_alpha_subunits|Wikipedia]]'
