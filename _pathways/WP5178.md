description: Fructose is converted into fructose-1-phosphate, this reaction is facilitated
  by fructokinase (also called ketohexokinase)(encoded by KHK). Connected to this
  reaction is the metabolic disease "essential fructosuria" which causes a deficiency
  in fructokinase. After this fructose-1-phosphate is converted into glyceraldehyde
  and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate, this is facilitated by aldolase B (encoded by ALDOB).
  connected to this reaction is the metabolic disease "hereditary fructose intolerance",
  which is the result of the absence of aldolase B. The glyceraldehyde produced from
  this reaction will be converted into D-glycerate through the activity of Aldehyde
  dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1 or ALDH1A1 (encoded by the ALDH1A1 gene). The
  D-glycerate will be converted (according to the book) into 2-Phosphoglyceric acid
  through the activity of Glycerate kinase (encoded by GLYCTK), connected to this
  reaction is the metabolic disease "glycerate kinase deficiency" which results in
  the accumulation of D-glycerate. The resulting 2-phosphoglyceric acid then goes
  through a series of reactions resulting in pyruvate.  Another entry into this pathway
  is through the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate through
  glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (encoded by GPI). The fructose-6-phosphate can be
  converted into fructose-1,6-biphosphate through phosphofructokinase (encoded by
  PFKL). Fructose-1,6-biphosphate can be converted into fructose-6-phosphate by fructose-1,6-biphosphatase,
  connected to this reaction is the metabolic disease "Fructose-1,6-biphosphatase
  deficiency". When going further, the fructose-1,6-biphosphate is converted into
  dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate through the activity of
  aldolase B, this reaction is also affected by hereditary fructose intolerance. The
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is then eventually turned into pyruvate through a series
  of reactions. The dihydroxyacetone-phosphate resulting from the aldolase B involved
  reactions can be converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate through the activity
  of triose-phosphate isomerase (encoded by TPI1). This pathway is based on the fructose
  metabolism pathway (Chapter 18, Figure 18.5) in the book Physicians Guide to the
  Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases (ed. 4) by Nenad
  Blau, Marinus Duran, K Michael Gibson, Carlo Dionisi.(ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361))
