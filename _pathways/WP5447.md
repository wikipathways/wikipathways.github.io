description: Factors in GLP-1 production in pancreatic alpha cells, and the hypothetical
  function of resulting GLP-1 in pancreatic beta cells.  Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
  is a short protein that suppresses feeding and helps manage glucose levels in diabetes.  It
  is encoded by the GCG gene.  Based on Figure 3 in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9190119.
