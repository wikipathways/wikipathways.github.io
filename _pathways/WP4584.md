description: Pyrimidine metabolism disorders are caused by enzyme defects in the metabolism
  of pyrimidine (WP4225). The clinical presentation of pyrimidine disorders is very
  diverse, because of the diversity in biological function. The severity of the disorder
  is determined by the severity of the defect and the function of the normal enzyme.
  The diagnosis of Pyrimidine metabolism disorders is based on altered concentrations
  of different metabolic biochemical markers. Some of these markers are metabolites
  in the pyrimidine metabolism, but there are also several other markers, that are
  either indirectly or not related to pyrimidine metabolism. All metabolic markers
  used for the diagnosis of at least one Pyrimidine metabolism disorder and their
  relations are visualized in this pathway.  Biochemical markers derived from http://www.iembase.org/,
  for all diseases pictured in WP4225.
