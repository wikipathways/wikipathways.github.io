description: 'Microtubules (MTs) are essential for vesicle transport, cellular polarity
  and the segregation of chromosomes during mitosis.  MTs are dynamic, undergoing
  assembly and depolymerization (primarily at the "plus end") by processes actively
  regulated by signaling pathways. The tubulin dimers that constitute MTs (depicted
  in green) are bound and sequestered by stathmin (STMN1), enhancing MT dynamics by
  increasing rapid depolymerization (a.k.a., "MT catastrophe").   MT dynamics are
  also enhanced by collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP2), which increases MT
  growth by promoting the addition of tubulin dimers onto microtubule plus ends. Other
  proteins that associate with assembled MTs include those that stabilize MTs (e.g.
  tau or MAPT), those that promote assembly (e.g., XMAP215), and those that maintain
  MTs in a dynamic state (e.g., MAP1B). Complexes between the adenomateous polyposis
  coli (APC) protein and plus end binding proteins (e.g., EB1) stabilize MTs by increasing
  the duration of the MT elongation phase. MT instability is promoted by several nonmotile
  kinesins from the kinesin-13 family, e.g., the mitotic centromere associated kinesin,
  MCAK, by accelerating the transition to catastrophe by weakening the lateral interactions
  between the protofilaments.  Upstream from these processes, major signaling pathways
  act to regulate MT dynamics, e.g., those converging on GSK3B, a kinase which targets
  tau and CRMP2.  Reference: https://www.cellsignal.com/contents/science-pathway-research-cytoskeletal/regulation-of-microtubule-dynamics-signaling-pathway/pathways-micro  Proteins
