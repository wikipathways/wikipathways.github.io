description: 'Control of immune tolerance by VIP controls immune homeostasis.  Vasoactive
  intestinal peptide (VIP) is released from nerve terminals (nervous source) and blood
  (endocrine source), or produced by T helper 2 (Th2) cells or macrophages (immune
  source) in response to antigenic and inflammatory stimulation. VIP induces immune
  tolerance and inhibits the autoimmune response through different non-excluding mechanisms.
  First, it induces the generation and differentiation of Th2 cells functions and
  decrease Th1 cell functions through direct actions on differentiating T cells, or
  indirectly by regulating antigen presenting cell (APC) functions. As a consequence,
  the inflammatory and autoimmune responses are impaired, and the anti-helminthic
  and atopic responses are increased, because the infiltration and activation of neutrophils
  and macrophages by interferon-γ (IFNγ) and the production of complement-activating
  IgG2 antibodies are avoided. Second, VIP impairs the co-stimulatory activity of
  APCs on effector T cells, inhibiting subsequent clonal expansion. This avoids the
  inflammatory response and its cytotoxic effect against the target tissue. Third,
  VIP induces the generation of regulatory T cells that suppress the activation of
  autoreactive T cells by producing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth
  factor-β (TGFβ). This effect contributes to the maintenance of an anti-inflammatory
  state and restores immune tolerance. '
