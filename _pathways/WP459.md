description: L-serine biosynthesis is a major metabolic pathway in many organisms.
  Its end product, L-serine, is not only used in protein synthesis, but also as a
  precursor for the biosynthesis of glycine, cysteine, tryptophan, and phospholipids.
  In addition, it directly or indirectly serves as a source of one-carbon units for
  the biosynthesis of various compounds.  In the pathway described here, which operates
  in bacteria, yeast, some protists, plant plastids and animals, serine is derived
  from 3-phospho-D-glycerate, an intermediate of glycolysis.  Regulation of the pathway
  is mainly accomplished by feedback inhibition of the enzyme that catalyzes the first
  committed step, SER3/SER33, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase. The second enzyme in
  the pathway, SER1, phosphoserine transaminase, requires pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)
  as a cofactor and is also required for the biosynthesis of PLP itself. Thus the
  cell must ensure that the supply of PLP is adequate. Little biochemical work has
  been done on the final enzyme of the pathway, SER2, phosphoserine phosphatase.  Description
