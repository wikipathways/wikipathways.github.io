description: This pathway is inspired by the [Lipidmaps>Sterol lipids expended pathway
  display](https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps) and extended with Scheme 1
  from [Acimovic et al 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23558541). Literature
  suggests that cholesterol synthesis preferentially starts with the Bloch pathway,
  however there is a shift to the Kandutsch-Russell part via lathosterol ([Bae et
  al, 1997](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9291139)).  Dashed lines indicate
  that multiple steps are involved to create the final product. Several regulatory
  effects concerning the metabolites of cholesterol have been indicated as well. The
  content from the Bloch and Kandutsch-Russel pathways have been checked against literature,
  and differences compared to the original LipidMaps pathway have been coloured turquoise.
