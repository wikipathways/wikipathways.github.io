description: '"AMPK regulates mammary milk protein synthesis: mTORC1 is the master
  regulator that controls milk protein synthesis in the mammary gland through 4EBP1
  and S6K1. AMPK directly inhibits mTORC1 through the phosphorylation of raptor at
  Ser 792. AMPK also decreases mTOR activity through the phosphorylation of TSC2 (a
  negative mTORC1 regulator) at Ser1345. The genes encoding as1-casein (CSN1S1), β-casein
  (CSN2) and κ-casein (CSN3) are also decreased with the activation of AMPK."  Derived
  from Figure 4 in https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7332552.'
