description: This pathway was constructed based on the Brown et al 2021 book chapter
  (Cholesterol Synthesis), combined with the Reactome Cholesterol Synthesis pathway
  (DOI:10.3180/R-HSA-191273.7) and the WikiPathways WP4718 (Cholesterol metabolism
  with Bloch and Kandutsch-Russell pathways (Homo sapiens)). Additional information
  was incorporated based on the literature. All protein were curated for cell-specific
  (hepatocyte) isoforms.
