description: 'IL23 inhibitor drugs decrease an intestinal immune response that contributes
  to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), like Crohn''s disease and ulcerative colitis.  IL23
  inhibitors like risankizumab (Skyrizi), guselkumab (Tremfya), mirikizumab (Omvoh),
  and brazikumab (MEDI2070) bind to IL23p19 (a.k.a. p19), the protein product of gene
  IL23A.  That in turn blocks IL23A protein from binding to its receptor in immune
  cells, preventing the production of downstream inflammatory interleukins, cytokines,
  and other factors that manifest as IBD.  IL-23 plays a crucial role in immune responses,
  especially in the intestinal mucosa. It has a novel p19 protein subunit, which interacts
  with the p40 subunit. This interaction activates the STAT4-JAK2 pathway. Major cells
  producing IL-23 include macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, particularly
  in response to microbial stimuli via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Intestinal epithelial
  cells (IECs) can also produce IL-23.  IL-23 binds to its receptor, which consists
  of two subunits: IL12 receptor β1 (common to both IL-12 and IL-23 receptors) and
  IL23Rα. The binding triggers a conformational change in the receptor, activating
  the JAK2 and TYK2 kinases, which then phosphorylate each other and the receptor
  itself. This phosphorylation allows for the binding of STAT proteins, mainly STAT3.
  These phosphorylated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they activate
  RORγt, a master transcription factor that drives the expression of IL-17-related
  genes.  This signaling pathway primarily promotes the proliferation of Th17 cells,
  rather than their differentiation, since naive T cells lack IL-23 receptors. The
  activation also induces the production of various cytokines, including IL-17A/F,
  IL-22, IL-6, GM-CSF, TNFα, and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) by IECs. In addition
  to Th17 cells, other immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells, natural killer T cells,
  γδ T cells, type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), and dendritic cells, are also involved
  in this IL-23-driven immune response.  Inspired by [figure 1, Bourgonje et al. 2025](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(24)05124-2/fulltext).'
