description: An analysis of the mevalonate branch of the cholesterol biosynthesis
  pathway, and a set of inhibitors directed against targets in this pathway. Inhibitors
  which have been found for Homo Sapiens are coloured red, those found for Rattus
  norvegicus orange.  View more details on where these reactions in the cell take
  place at [WP4190](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4190). View the
  broader scope of cholesterol metabolism at [WP430](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP430).
