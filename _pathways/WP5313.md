description: This pathway shows the synthesis and degradation of Carnosine as well
  as the distribution within glial cells in the brain.  The synthesis pathway starts
  at two different locations, with beta-alanine being transported from the liver and
  l-histidine being transported from the intestines, since it needs to be ingested.
  As can be seen, various transports bring these two amino acids across the blood
  brain barrier and into the oligodendrocyte where the actual synthesis of carnosine
  happens by CARNS1. The degradation of carnosine also occurs within the oligodendrocyte
  by CN1 and CN2.  The oligdendrocytes are the only glial cells in the brain which
  produce carnosine, but all of them use it, so distribution to other glial cells
  is necessary. The transport to microglia is done by SLC14A2 and 4, while transport
  to astrocytes only requires SLC14A2. Carnosine also has an impact on the glutamate
  transporter of the astrocyte, which is SLC1A2, also known as GLT-1. Carnosine stimulates
  the transporter, which brings more glutamate and sodium into the cell. The sodium
  concentration within the cell will be increased, leading to a higher activity of
  the ATPase. This generates more ADP, which can be used within glycolysis. This then
  builds a connected to the lactate shuttle which occurs between the astrocyte and
  neurons, in which the astrocyte produces lactate from pyruvate to give the neurons
  additional energy support.
