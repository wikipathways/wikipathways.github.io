description: Copper is a redox-active transition metal and an essential trace element
  for life. It is a catalytic cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in critical biological
  processes (e.g. detoxification by oxygen free radicals, angiogenesis, pigmentation,
  peptide hormone production, etc.). However, "free" copper is harmful for cells because
  it can generate ROS that leads to cellular damage. Thus, all organisms and cells
  maintain a tight control of its uptake, trafficking and export. This process is
  rather intricate and requires an interplay between numerous biomolecules (e.g. proteins,
  metabolites) that act as copper ions importers (CTR1, CTR2, DMT1, Prp, APP), chaperones
  (CCS, ATOX1, COX17, COMMD1) and exporters (ATP7A, ATP7B). Copper ions and Cu-independent
  stimuli (hormone, oxygen, phosphorylation and ubiquination) seem to affect localization
  and expression of Cu-transporters and chaperones. Potential targets of copper ions
  seem to be crucial signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt, in which copper induces
  insulin-like effects. Copper dyshomeostasis could be implicated in cancer and a
  number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's
  disease, prion disease and ALS.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available
  via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3286).
