description: Base excision repair is a cellular mechanism that repairs damaged DNA
  throughout the cell cycle. It is primarily responsible for removing small, non-helix-distorting
  base lesions from the genome.  Base excision repair is important for removing damaged
  bases that could otherwise cause mutations by mispairing, or could lead to breaks
  in DNA during replication.   BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases, which recognize
  and remove specific damaged or inappropriate bases, forming AP sites. These are
  then cleaved by an AP endonuclease. The resulting single-strand break can then be
  processed by either short-patch (where a single nucleotide is replaced) or long-patch
  BER (where 2-10 new nucleotides are synthesized). The choice between short- and
  long-patch repair is currently under investigation. Various factors are thought
  to influence this decision, including the type of lesion, the cell cycle stage,
  and whether the cell is terminally differentiated or actively dividing. Some lesions,
  such as oxidized or reduced AP sites, are resistant to pol β lyase activity and
  therefore must be processed by long-patch BER.  This pathway is based on information
  from REPAIRtoire (http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/4/), Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_excision_repair)
  and KEGG (https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?map03410). The description was
  adapted from REPAIRtoire, layout is based on KEGG.
