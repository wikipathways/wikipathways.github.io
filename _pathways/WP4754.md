description: Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines and
  was initially described as an IFN-γ-inducing factor derived from anti-CD3-stimulated
  T-helper (Th)1 cells. IL-18 plays a significant role in the activation of hematopoietic
  cell types mediating both Th1 and Th2 responses and is the primary inducer of interferon-γ
  in these cells. The biological activity of IL-18 is mediated through its binding
  to the IL-18 receptor complex and activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), culminating
  in the production and release of several cytokines, chemokines, and cellular adhesion
  molecules. In certain cell types, IL-18 also activates mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/ AKT serine/threonine kinase (PI3K/AKT)
  signaling modules leading to the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines.
  IL-18-mediated signaling acts as one of the vital components of the immunomodulatory
  cytokine networks involved in host defense, inflammation, and tissue regeneration.
  Albeit its biomedical importance, a comprehensive resource of IL-18 mediated signaling
  pathway is currently lacking. In this study, we report on the development of an
  integrated pathway map of IL-18/IL-18R signaling. The pathway map was developed
  through literature mining from published literature based on manual curation guidelines
  adapted from NetPath and includes information on 16 protein-protein interaction
  events, 38 enzyme-catalysis events, 12 protein translocation events, 26 activations/inhibition
  events, transcriptional regulators, 230 gene regulation events and 84 induced protein
  expression events.
