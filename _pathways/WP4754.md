description: 'Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines and
  was initially described as an IFN-ÃŽÂ³-inducing factor derived from anti-CD3-stimulated
  Th1 cells. IL-18 plays a significant role in the activation of hematopoietic cell
  types mediating both Th1 and Th2 responses and is the primary inducer of interferon-ÃŽÂ³
  in these cells. The biological activity of IL-18 is mediated through its binding
  to the IL-18 receptor complex (IL-18R) and activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB),
  culminating in the production and release of several cytokines, chemokines, and
  cellular adhesion molecules. In certain cell types, IL-18 also activates mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3K/AKT signaling modules leading to the production
  and release of proinflammatory cytokines. IL-18 mediated signaling acts as one of
  the vital components of the immunomodulatory cytokine networks involved in host
  defense, inflammation, and tissue regeneration. '
