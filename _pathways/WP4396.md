description: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which too
  much fat is stored in the liver. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; also known
  as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis / MASH) is a type of NAFLD marked
  by liver inflammation, which may progress to scarring and irreversible damage similar
  to that caused by heavy alcohol use. Components of glucose metabolism, insulin signaling,
  inflammation, oxidative stress, ER stress, and apoptosis are all involved and interconnected
  in the progression of this disease.
