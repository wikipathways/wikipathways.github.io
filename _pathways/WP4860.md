description: SARS-CoV-2 includes a novel Orf10 that interacts with muliple members
  of the Cullin 2 ubiquitin ligase complex as determined by AP-MS (Gordon 2020). The
  strongest interaction is with ZYG11B, a substrate adaptor for CUL2. By binding this
  complex, Orf10 might be able to hijack its activity. The hijacking of ubiquitination
  machinery is a common strategy of viruses to direct the degradation of viral restriction
  factors, for example. Also depicted here is the required neddylation (N8) of CUL2
  by the NAE enzyme complex. The ability of this enzyme to transfer N8 to CUL2 is
  inhibited by the small molecule Pevonedistat.
