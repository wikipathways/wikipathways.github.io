description: 'Selective expression of chemokine receptors during T-cell polarization.
  Pathway based on Biocarta pathway (M4047). https://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways/BioCarta/h_nktPathway  The
  polarization of T cells into Th1 and Th2 cells is associated with their expression
  of subsets of chemokine receptors. While not being exposed to antigens, naïve T
  cells express CXCR4 and CCR7 receptors. TGF-beta van induce semi-naive T cells,
  that express a subset of CCR4 and CCR7 receptors. Th1 express CXCR3, CCR1, CCR2
  and CCR5 receptors, while Th2 express CCR2, CCR3 and CCR5. However these subsets
  are not absolute as there is overlap between the expression of receptor subsets
  and thus between Th1 and Th2 cells. '
