description: 'The transport of iron between cells is mediated by transferrin. However,
  iron can also enter and leave cells not only by itself, but also in the form of
  heme and siderophores. When entering the cell via the main path (by transferrin
  endocytosis), its goal is not the (still elusive) chelated iron pool in the cytosol
  nor the lysosomes but the mitochondria, where heme is synthesized and iron-sulfur
  clusters are assembled (Kurz et al,2008, Hower et al 2009, Richardson et al 2010).Original
