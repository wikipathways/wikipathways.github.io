description: 'Immune cell infiltration in pancreatic cancer. Various factors are secreted
  in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that
  can either stimulate or inhibit PDAC development. Alteration of PDAC development
  by immune cells can be direct and/or indirect.  Used cell name abbreviations: MDSC
  = myeloid-derived suppressor cell, Treg = regulatory T cell, CAF = cancer associated
  fibroblast, PSC = pancreatic stellate cell, Th = CD4+ T helper cell.'
