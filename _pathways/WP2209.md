description: Phytoalexins Momilactone A and B accumulate in rice husks. Both compounds
  act in multiple ways such as (1) growth inhibitors involved in seed dormancy, (2)
  play an important role in the rice plant defense system against pathogens and insects
  and (3) contribute to allelopathy where they inhibit the growth of weeds. They are
  also known to be induced by the jasmonic acid plant growth hormone.
