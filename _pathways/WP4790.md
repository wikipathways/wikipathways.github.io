description: Hypophosphatemic rickets refers to a group of rare genetic disorders
  characterised by  clinical and radiographical features similar to rickets but caused
  by abnormalities in phosphate metabolism. The most common form, X-linked hypophosphatemic
  rickets (XLH), is caused by inactivating mutations in the PHEX gene, which encodes
  the phosphate-regulating neutral endopeptidase PHEX.  Patients with XLH have elevated
  levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which is thought to mediate many
  of the clinical manifestations of the disease. Elevated FGF23 levels have also been
  observed in other hypophosphatemic disorders, yet the role of FGF23 in the pathophysiology
  of these disorders is incompletely understood. This pathway illustrates hypophosphatemic
  and autocrine/paracrine molecular pathways that have been proposed to link FGF23
  to the bone abnormalities observed in XLH and related disorders. For further details,
  see [Beck-Nielsen et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30808384).
