description: 'This pathway was adapted from several resources and is designed to provide
  a theoretical frame-work for examining Wnt signaling and interacting components
  in the context of embryonic stem-cell pluripotency and self-renewal.  A central
  organizing theme of this pathway are known drug targets which promote self-renewal
  or pluripotency (BIO and IQ-1)  and implicated upstream regulators of the core pluripotency
  transcriptional components (e.g. Nanog).  It should be noted  that it is unclear
  whether all the depicted components participate in this pathway in human embryonic
  stem cells.  Interactions and object/gene groups for the pathway exist for the majority
  of components. '
