description: 'Calcium is a common signaling mechanism, as once it enters the cytoplasm
  it exerts allosteric regulatory affects on many enzymes and proteins. Calcium can
  act in signal transduction after influx resulting from activation of ion channels
  or as a second messenger caused by indirect signal transduction pathways such as
  G protein-coupled receptors. Movement of calcium ions from the extracellular compartment
  to the intracellular compartment alters membrane depolarisation. This is seen in
  the heart, during the plateau phase of ventricular contraction. In this example,
  calcium acts to maintain depolarisation of the heart.  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_signaling)'
