description: Expression patterns of two major tumor suppressor pathways in lung cancer.
  These pathways are functionally linked to lung cancer and play role as a component
  of checkpoints and growth inhibitory pathways. Components which/who are activated
  in this pathway are Egfr, Erbb2, Rasl11b, and MYC in the Oncogenic singalling part.
  Frequent inactivated are TGF-beta R1/2, RB, p16INK4A, Tp53, and p14ARF, whie infrequent
  inactivated are Smad2 and Sma4. Both, the p14ARF/p53 and the p16INK4A/RB pathway
  lead to cell cycle arrest.
