description: 'Lacto series glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. Lactosylceramides (abbreviated
  as LacCer) are a class of glycosphingolipids connecting a ceramide lipid to a sugar
  group. The exact chemical formula and molecular weight in this class of lipids varies
  depending on the connected fatty-acid.  Many of these structures are related to
  cancer development or antigens. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactosylceramide '
