description: 'Insulin resistance is strongly associated with type II diabetes. "Diabetogenic"
  factors including FFA, TNFalpha and cellular stress induce insulin resistance through
  inhibition of IRS1 functions. Serine/threonine phosphorylation, interaction with
  SOCS, regulation of the expression, modification of the cellular localization, and
  degradation represent the molecular mechanisms stimulated by them. Various kinases
  (ERK, JNK, IKKbeta, PKCzeta, PKCtheta and mTOR) are involved in this process.  The
  development of type II diabetes requires impaired beta-cell function. Chronic hyperglycemia
  has been shown to induce multiple defects in beta-cells. Hyperglycemia has been
  proposed to lead to large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in beta-cells,
  with subsequent damage to cellular components including PDX-1. Loss of PDX-1, a
  critical regulator of insulin promoter activity, has also been proposed as an important
  mechanism leading to beta-cell dysfunction.   Although there is little doubt as
  to the importance of genetic factors in type II diabetes, genetic analysis is difficult
  due to complex interaction among multiple susceptibility genes and between genetic
  and environmental factors. Genetic studies have therefore given very diverse results.
  Kir6.2 and IRS are two of the candidate genes. It is known that Kir6.2 and IRS play
  central roles in insulin secretion and insulin signal transmission, respectively.  Source:
  [KEGG](http://www.kegg.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+map04930).  Proteins on this
  pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1584).'
