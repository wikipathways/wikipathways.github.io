description: 'Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide secreted abundantly
  in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebral cortex and
  cerebellum in the central nervous system It is also expressed in adrenal gland,
  placenta, testis, spleen, gut, thymus and skin . CRH is the principal mediator of
  endocrine stress response . CRH also plays a significant role in inflammatory responses
  , hemodynamic actions , stromal cell decidualization during estrus cycle , implantation
  of blastocyst , maintenance of pregnancy, onset of labor  and neuroprotection .
  Excess secretion of CRH during severe depression and its association with increased
  levels of cortisol have been observed . CRH has also been reported to be involved
  in anxiety disorders , anorexia nervosa . Decrease in cortical CRH content has been
  observed in Alzheimer''s disease  and Parkinson''s disease .  The actions of CRH
  are mediated through class II/secretin-like family type of G-protein coupled receptor
  (GPCR) called the CRH receptors (CRHR) . CRH is a high affinity ligand of CRHR1
  and also binds to CRHR2 but with lower affinity . CRH receptors do not have any
  intrinsic kinase activity and transduce the signal via the heterotrimeric G-proteins
  . The CRH receptors are rapidly desensitized by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase
  (GRK) and Î²-arrestin mechanisms in the presence of high concentrations of CRH .
  Binding of CRH to CRH receptor induces a conformational change in the receptor by
  activating it. This further activates GÎ±-subunit and its subsequent dissociation
  from the GÎ²Î³ dimer. CRH receptors on interaction with GÎ±-subunit of different
  G-proteins such as GÎ±s, GÎ±i/o, GÎ±q/11 activate numerous downstream signaling
  cascades and result in the induction of various cellular responses . The pathways
  that are activated upon CRH stimulation are: Adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA, PLC/PKC,
  ERK/MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B.   CRH binding to CRHR1 couples G-stimulatory
  (Gs) protein which in turn activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Activation
  of PKA leads to the phosphorylation of transcription factors like cAMP response
  element binding protein (CREB), which in turn increases the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin
  (POMC) gene and the release of POMC-derived peptides, adrenocorticotropic hormone
  (ACTH) and Î²-endorphin. ACTH, in turn, stimulates the secretion of glucocorticoids
  from adrenal glands and thereby mediates changes associated with stress response
  . CREB also regulates genes containing the Ca2+/cAMP response element such as FOS
  . The activation of cAMP by CRH induces the mRNA expression and transcription of
  orphan nuclear receptors NR4A1 and NR4A2, which in turn transcriptionally activates
  the expression of POMC . Activation of cAMP/PKA can also induce the expression of
  enzymes involved in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol production . The
  biological functions of CRH are also mediated by MAPK family, in particular MAPK1/3
  and MAPK14. MAPK1/3 mediates activation of transcription factors NR4A1 and NR4A2
  and induction of POMC in corticotrophs . MAPK14 is involved in CRH-induced inhibition
  of IL-18 expression in human keratinocytes . The CRHR1/PKA/ERK signaling activate
  the transcription factors - ELK1 , SP1 and TFAP2A. SP1 and TFAP2A up-regulates the
  expression of ADRBK2, which causes the desensitization of CRHR1 receptors .  The
  PLC/PKC pathway is activated by coupling of the CRH receptors to the GÎ±q/11 proteins.
  This cascade stimulates the formation of IP3 and contributes to the mobilization
  of intracellular calcium. Calcium is involved in the transcription regulation of
  FOS as well as NR4A1 and NR4A2 through CAMK2A. PLC/PKC is involved in the activation
  of AP-1 complex and subsequent transcriptional regulation of genes involved in keratinocyte
  differentiation and proliferation â€“ KRT1, KRT14 and IVL . This cascade also inhibits
  the expression of CYP11A1 and HSD3B1, the genes involved in progesterone synthesis
  in placental trophoblasts .  Another important signaling pathway activated upon
  CRH stimulation is the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP, involved in the control of vascular
  tone . In human keratinocytes, upon CRH stimulation, NFKBIA degradation is diminished
  and the activity of NFKB is inhibited resulting in the down-regulation of NFKB-dependant
  genes IL2 and HSP90AA1 and inhibition of cell proliferation . The gene involved
  in cell survival, BCL2 is transcriptionally regulated via the PI3K/AKT .  Please
