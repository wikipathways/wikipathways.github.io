description: The Aryl Hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is ligand activated transcription
  factor that regulates wide spectrum of gene expression. The main mediator of AhR
  is 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
  which are widespread environmental pollutant causing a variety of severe health
  effects, e.g. immunosuppression, carcinogenesis and hepatotoxicity.   AhR is a member
  of basic helix-loop-helix-Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) superfamily of transcription factors.
  In the absence of ligand, the AhR can be found in the cytosol, bound to a dimer
  of the heat shock protein of 90 kDa (Hsp90) and the immunophilin-like protein, AIP
  (also known as XAP2 and ARA9). Upon ligand binding, the AHR translocates to the
  nucleus and binds with ARNT. The AHR/ARNT heterodimer binds to xenobiotic response
  elements and regulates a diverse set of genes.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2586
