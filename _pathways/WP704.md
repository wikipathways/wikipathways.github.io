description: 'This pathway describes the addition of methyl groups to small molecules.
  SAM, S-Adenosyl methionine, is utilized as a methyl donor and SAH is produced. This
  process is important in drug metabolism.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP704). '
