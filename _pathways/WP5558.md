description: Suzetrigine (trade name Journavx) is an oral medication used to manage
  moderate to severe acute pain. It is a non-opioid, small-molecule analgesic that
  functions by selectively inhibiting Nav1.8-dependent pain signaling pathways in
  the peripheral nervous system. Unlike opioids, suzetrigine is non-addictive.  Inspired
  by Figure 2 in [Cho et al. (2025)](https://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological-sciences/abstract/S0165-6147(25)00028-8).
