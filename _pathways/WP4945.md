description: This pathway is a meta-pathway that represents an updated version of
  the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) of Inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I of
  nigro-striatal neurons leads to parkinsonian motor deficits [AOP-Wiki:3](https://aopwiki.org/aops/3).
  All Key Events are present as Key Event nodes, with their corresponding molecular
  pathways as pathway nodes.
