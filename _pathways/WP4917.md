description: This pathway provides an overview of all active transport that occurs
  in the proximal tubule of the nephron in the kidneys. The proximal tubule plays
  roles in regulating the pH of the filtrate, secreting organic waste, and reabsorption
  of NaCl, a large variety of solutes, and amino acids from the filtrate back into
  the circulation. The apical side indicates the proximal tubule which contains the
  filtrate after passing through Bowman's capsule, which later becomes the urine after
  passing through the complete nephron, from which solutes are reabsorbed (taken back
  into the body) and into which waste is secreted. Impaired ability of reabsorption
  by the proximal tubule can lead to Fanconi syndrome.
