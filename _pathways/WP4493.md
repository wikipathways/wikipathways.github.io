  title: Network-based identification genetic effect of SARS-CoV-2 infections to Idiopathic
    pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients (2020)
description: Cells and Molecules involved in local acute inflammatory response. Pathway
  based on Biocarta pathway (M3952) https://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways/BioCarta/h_LairPathway  Tissue
  damage induces the release of inflammatory signaling molecules. Additionally, bacterial
  infection stimulates an immune response. Bacterial infection can activate macrophages
  and induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and IL-1.
  Both tissue damage and bacterial infection can induce complement activation, either
  via the alternative or classical pathway. Leukocytes can be attracted via pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines released by mast cells and activated macrophages. Leukocytes
  can also induce complement activation.  The combined response can result in a more
  permeable endothelium of blood vessels, induce swelling and activate immune cells.
