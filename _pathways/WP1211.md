description: 'Simplified scheme of arylamine metabolism pathway. Arylamines are N-acetylated
  by NAT2 in the liver, transforming them to relatively nonreactive. Alternatively,
  they may be N-hydroxylated by CYPIA2, transported to the bladder, and undergo O-acetylation
  by NATI, to form a highly reactive species. '
