description: Dyslipidemia is a change (either increase or decrease) of adipose levels
  within the blood. When there is a significant increase of this, the term hyperlipidemia
  is used. With a significant decrease, we talk about hypolipoproteinemia. Both hyperlipidemia
  and hypolipoproteinemia can be classified as either acquired or familial.  Familial
  hyperlipidemia can be classified in five types according to the Fredrickson classification.For
  this classification see [Quispe et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.5114/aoms.2019.87207).  Lipodystrophy
  is a change (either increase or decrease) of adipose levels within the lipid tissue
  deposits. Lipodystrophy is classified based on wether the disease is acquired or
  congenital, but also wether it is geralized (through the entire body) or partial
  (in specific parts of the body). This classification was based on the following
  information by [Akinci et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513130/).
