description: The production of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and NADPH through the use
  of enzymes known as fatty acid synthases is referred to as fatty acid synthesis.
  This biological process occurs within the cytoplasm of cells. The majority of acetyl-CoA
  that is transformed into fatty acids originates from carbohydrates through the glycolytic
  pathway.
