description: This pathway visualises the conversion of methionine to inorganic sulphates
  (involving the formation of homocysteine, a  toxic intermediate also related to
  MTHFR deficiency ([WP4288](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4288)).
  Methionine, an essential amino acid, is taken in from diet and can be created from
  breaking down proteins.  This pathway was inspired by Chapter 3 of the book of Blau
  (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
