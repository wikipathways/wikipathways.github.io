description: 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which
  the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues.  It can lead to lupus
  nephritis, where the kidneys become inflamed.  This causes impaired kidney function
  and, in severe cases, kidney failure.  Lupus has an incidence of around 5 per 100,000
  person-years, and affects women much more frequently than men.  The development
  of lupus nephritis involves a complex interplay among B cells, T cells, dendritic
  cells (DCs), and other immune components. Key pathogenic mechanisms include:  1.  Overactive
  B cells produce excessive autoantibodies, leading to the formation of immune complexes
  that deposit in the kidneys. These deposits trigger complement activation and subsequent
  inflammation.  2.  Autoreactive B cells present self-antigens to T cells, promoting
  persistent immune dysregulation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  3.  Dendritic
  cells display abnormal recognition and presentation of self-antigens, which initiates
  and sustains autoimmune responses targeting renal tissues.  4.  B cell differentiation
  into plasma cells is dysregulated, resulting in continuous production of nephritogenic
  autoantibodies.  Understanding these immunopathogenic processes is critical for
  the development of targeted therapies aimed at preventing or reversing the progression
  of lupus nephritis.  Inspired by [Figure 2 in Su et al. (2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11522254/).'
