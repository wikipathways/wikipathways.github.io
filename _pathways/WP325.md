description: Triacylglyceride (or triglyceride) is a major component of skin oils,
  animal and vegetable fats, and supports the transfer of adipose and glucose between
  the liver and circulatory system. Triacylglyceride is synthesized from glycerol
  and three fatty acids. The terminal step of synthesis is performed by Diglyceride
  acyltransferase (DGAT).
