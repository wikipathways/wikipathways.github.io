description: 'Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common form of kidney cancer in
  adults, is not a single disease but rather a collection of different tumor types
  driven by distinct genetic changes that arise within the same tissue. Papillary
  RCC represents 15 to 20 percent of RCC diagnoses and can manifest as an aggressive,
  solitary tumor or as multiple, slow-growing tumors. Papillary RCC itself has two
  main subtypes, type 1 and type 2, that are distinguished histologically. Little
  is currently known about the genetic basis of non-hereditary papillary RCC and patients
  receive treatment simply based on disease stage. If caught early, the disease can
  usually be cured surgically. From https://ccr.cancer.gov/news/article/understanding-papillary-renal-cell-carcinoma  Based
  on [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05211) '
