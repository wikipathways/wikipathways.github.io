description: Carotenoids pigments in plants are a family of secondary metabolites
  that participate in light harvesting. They are essential for photoprotection against
  excess light. carotenoids are also the precursors for the biosynthesis of plant
  hormones such as abscisic acid and strigolactones. The biosynthesis occurs in the
  plastid organelle of higher plants.
