description: In (skeletal) muscle cells, PGC-1 signaling controls mitochondrial biogenesis
  and oxidative substrate metabolism. PGC-1 signaling disturbance in skeletal muscle
  is linked to several chronic diseases. This pathway depicts the mechanism in which
  inhibition of GSK-3β increases Pgc-1α abundance, through dephosphorylation of Tfeb
  [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2019.118610 Theeuwes et al, 2019]. This reaction
  allows Tfeb to translocate to the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription
  of the PPARGC1A gene to the Pgc-1α protein. Phosphorylation of Tfeb leads to binding
  with members of the 14-3-3 protein family, which disables transport into the nucleus.
  If the dephosphorylation of Tfeb through Gsk-3β is a direct or indirect reaction
  is as of yet unknown.
