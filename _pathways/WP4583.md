description: 'Urea cycle disorders are caused by enzyme defects in the Urea cycle
  ([WP4571](http://wikipathways.org/instance/WP4571)). The diseases are characterised
  by hyperammonemia, respiratory alkalosis and encephalopathy and the severity of
  the disease depends on the severity of the defect and the place of the defect in
  the cycle. Severe forms usually have an onset in infancy, while mild forms can also
  present in adulthood. The diagnosis of Urea cycle disorders is based on altered
  concentrations of different metabolic biochemical markers. Some of these markers
  are metabolites in Urea cycle, but there are also several other markers, that are
  either indirectly or not related to the Urea cycle. All metabolic markers used for
  the diagnosis of at least one Urea cycle disorder and their relations are visualized
  in this pathway.  Biochemical markers derived from [IEMBase](http://www.iembase.org/),
  for all diseases pictured in WP4571. '
