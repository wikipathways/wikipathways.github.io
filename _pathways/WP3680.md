description: This pathway is based on Figure 8 of "Mapping drug physico-chemical features
  to pathway activity reveals molecular networks linked to toxicity outcome."(See
  bibliography).   These 3 pathways demonstrate close links between pathways associated
  with chemical hits and pathways associated with toxicity. The pathways associated
  with chemical hits (Wnt signaling, long-term depression, and ErbB signaling pathways)
  and the pathways associated with toxicity (focal adhesion, ALS, and pancreatic Cancer
  respectively) have been shown to have possible links through shared genes between
  the two pathways. The mechanisms of action presented by these links were only implied
  by the toxicity pathways.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available
  via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3680 CPTAC Assay Portal]
