description: Overview of purine metabolism.  Metabolic markers are highlighted in
  red, with graphical arrows indicating if a marker is present in higher or lower
  concentrations compared to normal (healthy) levels.  This pathway was inspired by
  Chapter 13, edition 5 of the book of Blau (in press). The full version including
  disorders, based on ed. 4, can be found [here](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4224).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4792).
