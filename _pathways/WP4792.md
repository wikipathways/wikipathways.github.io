description: Overview of purine metabolism; metabolic markers are highlighted in red,
  with graphical arrows indicating if a marker is present in higher or lower concentrations
  compared to normal (healthy) levels.  This pathway was inspired by Chapter 13, edition
  5 of the book of Blau (in press). The full version of this PW including disorders,
  based on ed. 4, can be found [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4224
  here].  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4792
