description: Schematic representation of inhibition of exosome biogenesis and secretion
  by the antibiotic Manumycin A (MA) in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells
  (CRPC) cells. The inhibition of Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathway by MA leads to transcriptional
  down-regulation of hnRNP H1. A decrease in hnRNP H1 transcripts leads to inhibition
  of exosome biogenesis and secretion by suppressing ALIX and RAB27A.  Description
  from Datta et al.
