description: 'WNT signal, through the canonical pathway, controls cell fate determination
  and through the non-canonical pathway controls cell movement and tissue polarity.
  The name "wnt" is a fusion of two terms, wg derived from the Drosophila gene wingless
  (wg) and int derived from the proto-oncogene integration-1, which is the mammalian
  homolog of wg. ß-catenin is the key regulated effector of Wnt, involved in canonical
  signaling . Free ß-catenin is bound by a multiprotein "destruction complex". The
  ß-catenin destruction complex is comprised of ß-catenin, scaffold proteins (APC,
  AXIN) and serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate ß-catenin casein kinase 1
  (CSNK1A1, CSNK1D, CSNK1E, CSNK1G1) and GSK3B. The sequential phosphorylation of
  ß-catenin by casein kinase 1 and GSK3 is recognised by an SCF-class E3-ubiquitin
  ligase, which targets it for polyubiquitination and proteosomal destruction. Canonical
  WNT signals are transduced through a two-part receptor, a seven-transmembrane Frizzled
  (FZD) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/LRP6) to a
  ß-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling cascade. On recruitment of deshevelled (DVL1) to FZD
  and AXIN to LRP6, ß-catenin destruction complex disassembles leading to its stabilization
  and nuclear accumulation. Nuclear ß-catenin binds to T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer
  factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors and Legless family docking protein,
  BCL9. These activate the transcription of Wnt target genes CCND1, MYC. Non-canonical
  WNT signaling diverges downstream after being transduced through FZD family receptors
  and co-receptors, ROR2 and RYK. This pathway does not involve ß-catenin-mediated
  gene expression. Small G proteins such as RAC1, RHOA and downstream effectors of
  RAC including JNK are DVL-dependant effector molecules of the non-canonical pathway.
  These have been implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangement, dendrite growth and control
  of cell polarity and orientation. Nemo-like kinase (NLK) and nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT) are Ca2+-dependant effectors of the non-canonical pathway. NLK inhibits
  canonical pathway by phosphorylation of TCF/LEF family transcription factors. NFAT
  transcription factor is implicated in convergent extension during early embryogenesis
  and carcinogenic metastasis.    Please access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/wnt_pathway.html)
