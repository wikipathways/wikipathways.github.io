description: A graphical summary of the molecular signaling events involved in MFAP5-mediated
  ovarian cancer cell motility and invasiveness.  Based on figure 6c in [Leung et
  al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25277212). Phosphorylation sites were added
  based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.  Proteins on
  this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3301).
