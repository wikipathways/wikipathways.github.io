description: 'The enzymatic process that produces heme is properly called porphyrin
  synthesis, as all the intermediates are tetrapyrroles that are chemically classified
  are porphyrins. The process is highly conserved across biology. In humans, this
  pathway serves almost exclusively to form heme. In other species, it also produces
  similar substances such as cobalamin (vitamin B12).  The pathway is initiated by
  the synthesis of D-Aminolevulinic acid (dALA or Î´ALA) from the amino acid glycine
  and succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). The rate-limiting enzyme
  responsible for this reaction, ALA synthase, is strictly regulated by intracellular
  iron levels and heme concentration. A low-iron level, e.g., in iron deficiency,
  leads to decreased porphyrin synthesis, which prevents accumulation of the toxic
  intermediates. This mechanism is of therapeutic importance: infusion of heme arginate
  or hematin can abort attacks of porphyria in patients with an inborn error of metabolism
  of this process, by reducing transcription of ALA synthase.  The organs mainly involved
  in heme synthesis are the liver and the bone marrow, although every cell requires
  heme to function properly. Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism
  of haemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism.  Source: Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme'
