description: Pathogens are recognized by complement C1q or immunoglobulin (IgG) that
  bind to microglia complement receptors (e.g., ITGAM/ITGB2) or Fc-receptors (e.g.,
  FCGR1) that signal via the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing
  adaptor molecules TYROBP or FCER1G, respectively. Alternatively, pathogens are directly
  recognized by classical innate immune receptors (e.g., TREM2) that require the interaction
  with TYROBP for further signaling.  This pathway was converted from the original
  human pathway to mouse.
