description: 'The Cori cycle is also known as the Lactic acid cycle, and refers to
  the metabolic process in which lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis in the muscles
  is transported to the liver where it is converted to glucose, which then returns
  to the muscles and is metabolized back to lactate. It was discovered by Carl Ferdinand
  Cori and Gerty Cori.  Muscular activity requires ATP, which is provided by the breakdown
  of glycogen in the skeletal muscles.  During glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen
  produces glucose in the form of glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P), which is then converted
  to G-6-P by phosphoglucomutase.  G-6-P is fed into glycolysis, a process that provides
  ATP to the muscle cells as an energy source. It can also go into the pentose phosphate
  pathway if G-6-P concentration is high.  During muscular activity, ATP stores need
  to be constantly replenished. When the oxygen supply is sufficient, this energy
  comes from feeding pyruvate (from glycolysis), to the Krebs cycle.   When the oxygen
  supply is insufficient, for example during intense muscular activity, energy must
  be released through anaerobic metabolism.  During lactic acid fermentation, lactate
  dehydrogenase converts pyruvate to lactate. Fermentation regenerates NAD+, maintaining
  the NAD+ concentration so that additional glycolysis reactions can occur. The fermentation
  step oxidizes the NADH produced by glycolysis back to NAD+, transferring two electrons
  from NADH to reduce pyruvate into lactate. Lactacte produced by anaerobic fermentation
  does not accumulate inside the muscle cells, instead it is taken up by the liver,
  which initiates the other half of the Cori cycle. In the liver, gluconeogenesis
  reverses both glycolysis and fermentation by converting lactate first into pyruvate,
  and finally back to glucose. The glucose is supplied to the muscles through the
  bloodstream and is ready to be fed into further glycolysis reactions. If muscle
  activity has stopped, the glucose is used to replenish the supplies of glycogen
  through glycogenesis.  The glycolysis part of the cycle produces 2 ATP molecules
  at a cost of 6 ATP molecules consumed in the gluconeogenesis part. Each iteration
  of the cycle must be maintained by a net consumption of 4 ATP molecules. Therefor,
  the cycle cannot be sustained indefinitely. The Cori cycle shifts the metabolic
  burden from the muscles to the liver.  Source: Adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_cycle).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1946).'
