description: 'The Cori cycle (also known as the Lactic acid cycle), named after its
  discoverers, Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Cori, refers to the metabolic pathway
  in which lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis in the muscles moves to the liver
  and is converted to glucose, which then returns to the muscles and is metabolized
  back to lactate.  Muscular activity requires ATP, which is provided by the breakdown
  of glycogen in the skeletal muscles. The breakdown of glycogen, a process known
  as glycogenolysis, releases glucose in the form of glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P).
  The G-1-P is converted to G-6-P by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. G-6-P is readily
  fed into glycolysis, (or can go into the pentose phosphate pathway if G-6-P concentration
  is high) a process that provides ATP to the muscle cells as an energy source. During
  muscular activity, the store of ATP needs to be constantly replenished. When the
  supply of oxygen is sufficient, this energy comes from feeding pyruvate, one product
  of glycolysis, into the Krebs cycle. When oxygen supply is insufficient, typically
  during intense muscular activity, energy must be released through anaerobic metabolism.
  Lactic acid fermentation converts pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase.
  Most importantly, fermentation regenerates NAD+, maintaining the NAD+ concentration
  so that additional glycolysis reactions can occur. The fermentation step oxidizes
  the NADH produced by glycolysis back to NAD+, transferring two electrons from NADH
  to reduce pyruvate into lactate.  Instead of accumulating inside the muscle cells,
  lactate produced by anaerobic fermentation is taken up by the liver. This initiates
  the other half of the Cori cycle. In the liver, gluconeogenesis occurs. From an
  intuitive perspective, gluconeogenesis reverses both glycolysis and fermentation
  by converting lactate first into pyruvate, and finally back to glucose. The glucose
  is then supplied to the muscles through the bloodstream; it is ready to be fed into
  further glycolysis reactions. If muscle activity has stopped, the glucose is used
  to replenish the supplies of glycogen through glycogenesis. Overall, the glycolysis
  part of the cycle produces 2 ATP molecules at a cost of 6 ATP molecules consumed
  in the gluconeogenesis part. Each iteration of the cycle must be maintained by a
  net consumption of 4 ATP molecules. As a result, the cycle cannot be sustained indefinitely.
  The intensive consumption of ATP molecules indicates that the Cori cycle shifts
  the metabolic burden from the muscles to the liver. Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_cycle
