description: 'This pathway describes platelet-mediated interactions with vascular
  or circulating cells. It is adapted from figure 2 in [Koupenova et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29348254),
  in collaboration with Dr. Milka Koupenova.   Platelets interact with endothelial
  and immune cells in the circulation, and control the response to microbes, inflammatory
  stimuli, and vessel damage.  Through their TLRs or inflammatory signals, platelets
  can change their surface expression and release their granule content and in that
  way interact with different immune cells. Platelets form heterotypic aggregates
  with other immune cells and initiate innate immune responses in the presence of
  TLR agonists and viruses (encephalomyocarditis virus, coxsackievirus B, dengue,
  flu and HIV).  Platelets can also interact with dendritic cells through P-selectin,
  and activate them to become antigen-presenting through their CD154.  Platelets engage
  the adaptive immune response by releasing their granule content which leads to IgG
  production and control of T-cell function.  Similarly, platelets are able to activate
  the endothelium, make it more permeable, and mediate leukocyte trafficking to the
  inflamed endothelium.   Description is adapted from Koupenova et al. '
