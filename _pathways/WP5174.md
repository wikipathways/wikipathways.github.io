description: 'Ulcerative colitis (UC) together with Crohn’s disease (CD) are both
  chronic inflammation disorders in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and subtypes
  of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This inflammatory response in the GI tract
  is a result of various environmental and genetic components, microorganisms, and
  an impaired immune system. Among those many factors, changes in the luminal environment
  of the colonic epithelial cells are crucial and remain to be precisely analyzed.
  This pathway only considered UC, in which certain pathogens are found in increased
  or decreased amounts, compared to healthy controls.   In the upper section of the
  pathway, it is shown that the toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognized the components
  derived from microbes, such as flagellin, peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipopolysaccharide.
  As depicted on the left, also nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins,
  and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) recognized those microbial molecules. Activation
  of the TLR signaling pathway drives the upregulation of NF-kappa-B and its corresponding
  inflammation reaction. At the same time, the APC regulates the shift of naïve T-cells
  into effector T-cells and (Th2) and natural killer (NKT) T-cells. UC is mainly dominated
  by the Th2-type inflammation and the corresponding production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13
  and IL-10.  '
