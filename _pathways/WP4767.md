description: 'Taken from Achondroplasia: Development, Pathenogenesis, and [Therapy
  by Ornitz DM, Legeai-Mallet L](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27987249).  Signaling
  pathways in the postnatal growth plate. During endochondral bone development, FGF9
  and FGF18, derived from the perichondrium and surrounding tissue, signal to FGFR3
  in chondrocytes. The balance of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation is
  controlled by crosstalk of several signaling pathways. Expression of FGFR3 is enhanced
  by thyroid hormone (T3/3,3'',5''-Triiodothyronine) and suppressed by PTHLH (member
  of the parathyroid hormone family). FGFR3 signaling results in increased expression
  of Snail1 (encoded by SNAI1), which is required for activation of STAT1 and MAPK
  signaling (ERK1/2 and p38 branches). Signaling from PTHLH, IHH and BMPs antagonizes
  the suppression of chondrocyte proliferation by FGFR3. Both FGFR3 and PTHLH function
  to suppress chondrocyte differentiation and antagonize the action of Wnt signaling,
  which promotes differentiation. FGFR3 negatively regulates the autophagy protein,
  ATG5. Activation of downstream signals: PP2a (encoded by PPP2CA) regulates p107
  (encoded by RBL1) activation, and STAT1 regulates p21Waf1/Cip1 (encoded by CKDN1A)
  activation. Both function to suppress chondrocyte proliferation. Activation of the
  MAPKs, ERK1, and ERK2, regulate Sox9 expression, which functions to suppress chondrocyte
  terminal differentiation and endochondral ossification.  Linked with a dotted arrow
  to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene.  Protein
  phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R),
  www.phosphosite.org.'
