description: 'Acrylamide (AA) is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is converted
  to toxic glycidamide (GA) by cytochrome P450 2E1. Both AA and GA are coupled with
  glutathione (GSH) in the liver to form conjugates that are metabolized in the kidney
  and urinary tract to form modified merbapturic acids (AAMA and GAMA) that serve
  as biomarkers for AA in urine. Meanwhile, haemoglobin adducts are formed in the
  blood, including AA-Valine and GA-Valine. Genotoxic and carcinogenic activity is
  mediated by GA and the formation of DNA adducts with guanine and adenosine.   '
