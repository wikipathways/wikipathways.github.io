description: 'Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential cofactor for
  cellular redox reactions and energy metabolism. NAD also has been shown to be an
  important substrate in a variety of biological processes, including transcriptional
  regulation, DNA repair, calcium-dependent signaling pathways, calorie-restriction-mediated
  life-span extension and age-associated diseases. NAD appears to affect these processes
  by regulating the Sir2p family of NAD-dependent deacetylases. In addition to NAD
  biosynthesis pathways, there are four additional pathways for synthesizing NAD in
  yeast: two salvage pathways from the vitamin precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR)
  and two salvage pathways from nicotinic acid riboside (NaR). Three of these salvage
  pathways converge first with the NAD salvage pathway and then with the de novo pathway,
  while the fourth, the NR salvage pathway I, is independent of both of these pathways.
  In the NR salvage pathway I, NR is phosphorylated to nicotinamide mononucleotide
  by the kinase Nrk1p, and then adenylated to NAD by Nma1p or Nma2p.cYeast have a
  second NR salvage pathway (NR salvage pathway II) that is independent of Nrk1p;
  in NR salvage pathway II NR is split into a ribosyl product and nicotinamide, which
  is subsequently converted to NAD via enzymes of the NAD salvage pathway and de novo
  pathway. The initial steps in the two NaR salvage pathways are similar to those
  of the NR salvage pathways and are catalyzed by the same enzymes; Nrk1p catalyzes
  the first step in the NR and NaR salvage pathways I and Urh1p and Pnp1p catalyze
  the first steps of the NR and NaR salvage pathways II.  Description adapted from
