description: 'NAD+ biosynthetic pathways. NAD+ levels are maintained by three independent
  pathways. First, the Preiss-Handler pathway uses dietary nicotinic acid and the
  enzyme nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT) to generate NAMN, which
  is then transformed into NAAD by NAMN transferase (NMNAT). Three forms of this enzyme
  (NMNAT1, -2, and -3) have distinct subcellular localizations. The process is completed
  by the transformation of NAAD into NAD+ by NAD+ synthase (NADS). Second, the de
  novo synthesis pathway of NAD from tryptophan occurs through the kinurenine pathway
  (5). The first step in this pathway is the rate-limiting conversion of tryptophan
  to N-formylkinurenine (N-formylkin) by either IDO or TDO. Formylkinurenine is transformed
  into L-kinurenine (L-kin), 3-hydroxykinurenine, and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA)
  and finally to ACMS. This compound can spontaneously condense and rearrange into
  quinolinic acid, which is transformed into NAMN, at which point it converges with
  the Preiss-Handler pathway. ACMS can also be decarboxylated into AMS by ACMS decarboxylase
  (ACMSD), leading to its oxidation into acetyl-CoA via the TCA cycle. Third, the
  NAD+ salvage pathway recycles the nicotinamide generated as a by-product of the
  enzymatic activities of NAD+-consuming enzymes: sirtuins, PARPs, and the cADPR synthases
  (CD38 and CD157). Initially, NAMPT recycles nicotinamide into NMN, which is then
  converted into NAD+ via the different NMNATs.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3645
