description: 'Oxidative stress represents an imbalance between the production and
  manifestation of reactive oxygen species and a biological system''s ability to readily
  detoxify the reactive intermediates or to repair the resulting damage. Disturbances
  in the normal redox state of tissues can cause toxic effects through the production
  of peroxides and free radicals that damage all components of the cell, including
  proteins, lipids, and DNA. Some reactive oxidative species can even act as messengers
  through a phenomenon called redox signaling. In humans, oxidative stress is involved
  in many diseases. Examples include Sickle Cell Disease,[1] atherosclerosis, Parkinson''s
  disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, Alzheimer''s disease, Schizophrenia,
  Bipolar disorder, fragile X syndrome[2] and chronic fatigue syndrome, but short-term
  oxidative stress may also be important in prevention of aging by induction of a
  process named mitohormesis.[3] Reactive oxygen species can be beneficial, as they
  are used by the immune system as a way to attack and kill pathogens. Source: Wikipedia
