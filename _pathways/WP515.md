description: Gluconeogenesis is the generation of glucose from non-sugar carbon substrates
  such as pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids (primarily alanine
  and glutamine). The process is essentially the reversal of the glycolysis pathway.
  The pathway is particularly important in animals, as the production of glucose from
  other metabolites is necessary for use as a fuel source by the brain, testes, erythrocytes
  and kidney medulla, all of which can use only glucose as the energy source. Gluconeogenesis
  in animals is perfomed mostly in the liver. The pathway is carried by cytoplasmic
  enzymes to the level of glucose-6-phosphate. Since free glucose tends to freely
  diffuse out of the cell, actual glucose formation is carried out in the lumen of
  the endoplasmic reticulum by gluocose-6-phosphatase . Glucose is then shuttled into
  the cytosol by glucose transporters. The main souces of carbon for gluconeogenesis
  in animals is lactate, formed in skeletal muscle cells during anaerobic glycolysis
  and carried to the liver in the blood stream. The conversion of glucose into lactate
  by glycolysis and back to glucose by gluconeogenesis is referred to as the Cori
  Cycle.   Pathway summary from [MetaCyc](http://biocyc.org/)
