description: 'The intratumoral production of estradiol-17beta (E2) from circulating
  steroid hormone precursors plays an essential role in estrogen-related breast and
  epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). There are two possible pathways producing E2, one
  being the sulfatase pathway starting from estrone sulfate, and one being the aromatase
  pathway which starts with DHEA-S. Both routes rely on two crucial enzymes: STS for
  estrogen activation and SULT1E1 for inactivation. Research indicates that an increased
  STS expression and E2 production is associated with cancer progression. However,
  sulfonation of E2 via SULT1E1 not only reduces proliferative effects of estrogens
  on hormone-sensitive tumor cells, but also generates water-soluble estrogen sulfates
  consequently leading to an increased excretion of sulfonated E2. This helps preventing
  a metabolic activation of the hormone into potentially mutagenic catechol metabolites.
  Thus, targeting estrogen-modifying enzymes is a potential endocrine therapy strategy
  for patients with estrogen-sensitive EOC.  This pathway is based on Figure 1 from:
