description: 'This pathway shows metabolism of nicotine in human liver including all
  the candidate genes which may be responsible. Nicotine is extensively metabolized
  to a number of metabolites in liver. Quantitatively, the most important metabolite
  of nicotine in most mammalian species is cotinine. In humans, about 70 to 80% of
  nicotine is converted to cotinine. This transformation involves two steps. The first
  is mediated by the cytochrome P450 system (mainly CYP2A6 and CYP2B6) to produce
  nicotine iminium ion. Both of these genes have polymorphisms that can effect this
  process, for more details see VIP gene information for CYP2A6 and CYP2B6. The second
  step is catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase (AOX). Nicotine N''-oxide (NNO) is another
  primary metabolite of nicotine, although only about 4-7% of nicotine absorbed by
  smokers is metabolized via this route. The conversion of nicotine to NNO involves
  a flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). It appears that NNO is not further metabolized
  to any significant extent, except by reduction back to nicotine, which may lead
  to recycling of nicotine in the body. Nicotine glucuronidation results in an N-quaternary
  glucuronide in humans. This reaction is catalyzed by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase
  (UGT) enzyme(s) producing Nicotine-Gluc. Recent in vitro experiments suggest that
  UGT2B10 may be the primary enzyme in liver responsible for this conversion and that
  gene polymorphisms may influence this. About 3-5% of nicotine is converted to Nicotine-Gluc
  and excreted in urine in humans. Conversion of nicotine to nornicotine in humans
  has been demonstrated, and this process has been shown to be mediated by cytochrome
  P450 system in rabbits.  A number of cotinine metabolites have also been structurally
  characterized. Indeed, it appears that most of the reported urinary metabolites
  of nicotine are derived from cotinine. 3''-Hydroxycotinine (3HC) is the main nicotine
  metabolite detected in smokers'' urine. It is also excreted as a glucuronide conjugate
  (3HC-Gluc). 3HC and 3HC-Gluc account for 40-60% of the nicotine dose in urine. As
  with NNO, cotinine N-oxide (CNO) can be reduced back to the parent amine in vivo
  as evidenced by a study in rabbits. Studies with CYP enzyme inhibitors in hamster
  and guinea pig liver microsomes show, that unlike NNO, CNO is formed by CYP enzymes.
  Norcotinine has been detected in smokers'' urine (about 1% of total nicotine and
  metabolites). Two pathways for its formation are possible, demethylation of cotinine
  or oxidative metabolism of nornicotine. Animal and human studies have demonstrated
  the existence of both of these pathways.  There are additional important metabolites
  of nicotine that are not formed to any great extent endogenously as shown by experiments
  with nicotine patches as the drug delivery method, but are formed during the tobacco
  smoking process. The most well characterized as carcinogens so far are NNK (4-(methylnitrosamino)1(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone)
  and NNAL (4-(methylnitrosamino)1(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol). Although not depicted here
  these carcinogens are also metabolized by some of the same enzymes that metabolise
  nicotine including CYP2A6, UGT2B10, UGT1A4 and CYP2A13.  Sources: [PharmGKB:Nicotine
