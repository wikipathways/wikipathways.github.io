description: A model of apoptotic cell engulfment.   Caenorhabditis (from Caeno  and
  rhabditis = rod like stick shaped) elegans is a free living (non parasitic) transparent
  roundworm (nematode).  C. elegans was the first organism to have its whole genome
  sequenced and it neuronal wiring described.  The C. elegans engulfment pathway removes
  the dying ("corpse") cells by using receptor signals then identifying the dying
  cells and eventually engulfing them.  The final process involves the recycling of
  the remaining cell particles of the dead engulfed cells.
