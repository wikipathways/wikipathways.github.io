description: 'In S. cerevisiae, the biosynthesis of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine
  begins with two intermediates from amino acid metabolism: ornithine, an intermediate
  of arginine biosynthesis and degradation, and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a metabolite
  of methionine and a ubiquitous methyl group donor for many biological reactions.
  At the start of the pathway, ornithine is decarboxylated to putrescine by ornithine
  decarboxylase (Spe1p) while S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (Spe2p) decarboxylates
  AdoMet. Spermidine synthase (Spe3p) then catalyzes the transfer of an aminopropyl
  group from decarboxylated AdoMet to putrescine, converting the two substrates to
  5-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and spermidine, respectively. In an analogous reaction,
  spermidine can go on to react with decarboxylated AdoMet via spermine synthase (Spe4p)
  to yield spermine and another molecule of MTA. Spermidine but not spermine is essential
  for growth in S. cerevisiae.  MTA, a major byproduct of the polyamine biosynthesis
  pathway, is also the principal substrate for the methionine salvage pathway. The
  methionine salvage pathway recycles MTA produced during polyamine biosynthesis or
  other cellular processes back into methionine. In S. cerevisiae, the polyamine biosynthesis
  pathway and the methionine salvage pathway together are estimated to account for
  11-19% of the methionine used by a methionine auxotroph grown on limiting methionine.  Description
