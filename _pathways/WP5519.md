description: NMRK2 mRNA acts as a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and enhancing mitochondrial
  respiration in NONO-TFE3 translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC).  NMRK2 functions
  as a molecular scaffold to promote mitochondrial function in these cancer cells,
  independent of NAD+ kinase activity.  NMRK2 upregulation contributes to tumor progression
  by improving cellular energy production through enhanced mitochondrial respiration.
  Targeting NMRK2 might help treat this aggressive RCC subtype.
