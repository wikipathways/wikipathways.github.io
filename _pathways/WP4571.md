description: The urea cycle converts toxic nitrogenous compounds to excretable urea
  in five biochemical reactions. It is also the source for endogenous arginine, ornithine
  and citrulline production. The process mainly takes place in the liver, partly in
  the mitochondria and partly in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes.  Because there is no
  alternative way to convert toxic nitrogenous compounds, defects in the enzymes or
  transporters can lead to several diseases (highlighted in pink). The diseases are
  characterized by hyperammonemia, respiratory alkalosis and encephalopathy.  The
  severity of the disease depends on the severity of the defect and the place of the
  defect in the cycle. Severe forms usually onset in infancy, while mild forms can
  also present in adulthood.  This pathway is based on [Mew NA, et al. Urea cycle
  disorders overview (2003)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1217/).
