description: 'The urea cycle converts toxic nitrogenous compounds to excretable urea
  in five biochemical reactions. It is also the source for endogenous arginine, ornithine
  and citrulline production. The process mainly takes place in the liver, partly in
  the mitochondria and partly in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes.  Because there
  is no alternative way to convert toxic nitrogenous compounds, defects in the enzymes
  or transporters can lead to several diseases (diseases highlighted in pink). The
  diseases are characterised by hyperammonemia, respiratory alkalosis and encephalopathy
  and the severity of the disease depends on the severity of the defect and the place
  of the defect in the cycle. Severe forms usually have an onset in infancy, while
  mild forms can also present in adulthood.  This pathway is based on: [Mew NA, et
  al. Urea cycle disorders overview (2003)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1217/).'
