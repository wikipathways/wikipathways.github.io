description: 'While Saccharomyces cerevisiae can use most amino acids as their sole
  nitrogen source, they can only use a few amino acids as a carbon source to support
  growth (CITS:[Large86][Cooper82]).  This is in contrast to most eukaryotes and some
  fungi, which can metabolize amino acids completely, utilizing them as sole sources
  of carbon and nitrogen (CITS:[Stryer88][Large 86]). S. cerevisiae degrade the aromatic
  amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) and the branched-chain amino
  acids (valine, leucine, and iso-leucine) via the Ehrlich pathway (CITS:[Sentheshanmuganathan60][10989420]).  This
  pathway is comprised of the following steps:  1) deamination of the amino acid to
  the corresponding alpha-keto acid; 2) decarboxylation of the resulting alpha-keto
  acid to the respective aldehyde; and, 3) reduction of the aldehyde to form the corresponding
  long chain or complex alcohol, known as a fusel alcohol or fusel oil (CITS:[10989420][Large
  86]).  Fusel alcohols are important flavor and aroma compounds in yeast-fermented
  food products and beverages (as reported in (CITS:[9546164]).   Aro10p appears to
  be the primary decarboxylase catalyzing the second step in phenylalanine degradation
  (CITS:[12902239][15933030]).   Although Vulrahan et. al. (2003) (CITS:[12902239])
  found that THI3 does not encode an active phenylpyruvate decarboxylase, they found
  Thi3p was required in conjunction with one of the pyruvate decarboxylases  Pdc1p,
  Pdc5p or Pdc6p for the ARO10-independent decarboxylase activity.   The main uptake
  systems for utilizing aromatic amino acids appear to be Gap1p, a general amino acid
  permease, and Wap1p, an inducible amino acid permease with wide substrate specificity
