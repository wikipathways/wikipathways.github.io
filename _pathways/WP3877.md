description: This pathway is based on figure 7 from Li et al. Formation of MyD88 dimer
  catalyzes formation of IRAK1/TRAF6 complex. UEV1A and Ubc13 ubiquinate TRAF6 which
  allow for the activation of NFKB and AP-1 through canonical IKK phosphorylation.
  This complex also induces the production of reactive oxygen species.  Proteins on
  this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3877).
