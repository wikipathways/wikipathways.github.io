description: 'Glycogen is a very large, branched polymer of glucose residues. Within
  skeletal muscle and liver glucose is stored as glycogen. In the liver, glycogen
  synthesis and degradation are regulated to maintain blood-glucose levels as required
  to meet the needs of the organism as a whole. In contrast, in muscle, these processes
  are regulated to meet the energy needs of the muscle itself.   Glycogen synthesis
  Glycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic. This means that glycogen
  synthesis requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from
  UTP, which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in reaction catalyzed
  by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose
  by the enzyme glycogen synthase, which progressively lengthens the glycogen chain
  with (a1->4) bonded glucose. As glycogen synthase can only lengthen an existing
  chain, the protein glycogenin is needed to initiate the synthesis of glycogen. The
  glycogen-branching enzyme, amylo (a1->4) to (a1->6) transglycosylase, catalyzes
  the transfer of a terminal fragment of 6-7 glucose residues from a nonreducing end
  to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen
  molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues,
  and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.  Glycogen
  degradation Glycogen degradation consists of three steps: (1) the release of glucose
  1-phosphate from glycogen, (2) the remodeling of the glycogen substrate to permit
  further degradation, and (3) the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate into glucose
  6-phosphate for further metabolism.  Information partly derived from "Biochemistry"
  by Stryer and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen).'
