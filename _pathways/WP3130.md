description: 'In this model, we provide an integrated view of Sudden Infant Death
  Syndrome (SIDS) at the level of implicated tissues, signaling networks and genetics.
  The purpose of this model is to serve as an overview of research in this field and
  recommend new candidates for more focused or genome wide analyses. SIDS is the sudden
  and unexpected death of an infant (less than 1 year of age), almost always during
  deep sleep, where no cause of death can be found by autopsy. Factors that mediate
  SIDS are likely to be both biological and behavioral, such as sleeping position,
  environment and stress during a critical phase of infant development (http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/Sudden_Infant_Death_Syndrome.cfm).
  While no clear diagnostic markers currently exist, several polymorphisms have been
  identified which are significantly over-represented in distinct SIDS ethnic population.
  The large majority of these polymorphisms exist in genes associated with neuronal
  signaling, cardiac contraction and inflammatory response. These and other lines
  of evidence suggest that SIDS has a strong autonomic nervous system component (PMID:12350301,
  PMID: 20124538). One of the neuronal nuclei most strongly implicated in SIDS has
  been the raphe nucleus of the brain stem. In this nuclei there are ultrastructural,
  cellular and molecular changes associated with SIDS relative to controls (PMID:19342987,
  PMID: 20124538). This region of the brain is responsible for the large majority
  of neuronal serotonin produced and is functionally important in the regulation of
  normal cardiopulmonary activity, sleep and thermoregulation (see associated references).  Genes
  associated with serotonin synthesis and receptivity have some of the strongest genetic
  association with SIDS. Principle among these genes the serotonin biosynthetic enzyme
  TPH2, the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 and the serotonin receptor HTR1A. SLC6A4
  exhibits decreased expression in the raphe nucleus of the medulla oblongata and
  polymorphisms specifically associated with SIDS (PMID:19342987). In 75% of infants
  with SIDS, there is decreased HTR1A expression relative to controls along with an
  increase in the number of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:19342987). Over-expression
  of the mouse orthologue of the HTR1A gene in the juvenile mouse medulla produces
  an analogous phenotype to SIDS with death due to bradycardia and hypothermia (PMID:18599790).
  These genes as well as those involved in serotonin synthesis are predicted to be
  transcriptionally regulated by a common factor, FEV (human orthologue of PET-1).
  PET-1 knock-out results in up to a 90% loss of serotonin neurons (PMID:12546819),
  while polymorphisms in FEV are over-represented in African American infants with
  SIDS. In addition to FEV, other transcription factors implicated in the regulation
  of these genes (Putative transcriptional regulators (TRs)) and FEV are also listed
  (see associated references). In addition to serotonin, vasopressin signaling and
  its regulation by serotonin appear to be important in a common pathway of cardiopulmonary
  regulation (PMID:2058745). A protein that associates with vasopressin signaling,
  named pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ADCYAP1), results in a
  SIDS like phenotype, characterized by a high increase in spontaneous neonatal death,
  exacerbated by hypothermia and hypoxia (PMID:14608012), when disrupted in mice.
  Protein for this gene is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system
  (CNS), including autonomic control centers (PMID:12389210). ADCYAP1 and HTR1A are
  both predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by REST promoter binding. Regulation
  of G-protein coupled signaling pathways is illustrated for these genes, however,
  it is not clear whether ADCYAP1 acts directly upon raphe serotonin neurons.   Another
  potentially important class of receptors in SIDS is nicotine. Receptors for nicotine
  are expressed in serotonin neurons of the raphe throughout development (PMID:18986852).  Application
  of nicotine or cigarette smoke is sufficient to inhibit electrical activity of raphe
  serotonin neurons (PMID:17515803) and chronic nicotine infusion in rats decreases
  expression of SLC6A4 (PMID:18778441). Furthermore, nicotine exposure reduces both
  HTR1A and HTR2A immunoreactivity in several nuclei of the brainstem (PMID:17451658).  In
  addition to CNS abnormalities, several studies have identified a critical link between
  cardiac arrhythmia (long QT syndrome) and SIDS (PMID:18928334). A number of genetic
  association studies identified functionally modifying mutations in critical cardiac
  channels in as many as 10% of all SIDS cases (PMID:18928334). These mutations have
  been predicted to predispose infants for long QT syndrome and sudden death. The
  highest proportion of SIDS associated mutations (both inherited and sporadic) is
  found in the sodium channel gene SCN5A. Examination of putative transcriptional
  regulators for these genes, highlights a diverse set of factors as well as a relatively
  common one (SP1).  Finally, several miscellaneous mutations have been identified
  in genes associated with inflammatory response and thermoregulation. Infection is
  considered a significant risk factor for SIDS (PMID:19114412). For inflammatory
  associated genes, such as TNF alpha, interleukin 10 and complement component 4,
  many of these mutations are only significant in the presence of infection and SIDS.
  In addition to these mutations, cerebrospinal fluid levels of IL6 are increased
  in SIDS cases as well as IL6R levels in the arcuate nucleus of the brain, another
  major site of serotonin synthesis (PMID:19396608). Genes such as ILR6 and ADCYAP1
  are also associated with autoimmune disorders, thus SIDS may also be associated
  with autoinflammation of autonomic centers in the brain. Regulation of thermogenesis
  by brown adipose tissue has been proposed be an important component of SIDS, given
  that SIDS incidence is highest in the winter time and that animal models of SIDS
  demonstrate variation in body temperature. Interestingly, activation of raphe HTR1A
  decreases both shivering and peripheral vasoconstriction in piglets (18094064).
  Although a putative significant polymorphism was identified in the thermoregulator
  gene HSP60, this only occurred in one SIDS case. It is important to note that in
  the large majority of all these studies, sleeping position and smoking were among
  the most significant risk factors for SIDS.   In loving memory of Milo Salomonis
