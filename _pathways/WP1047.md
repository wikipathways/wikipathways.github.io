description: Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a proinflammatory cytokine involved
  in various biological processes including regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation,
  apoptosis and immune response. TNFα is mainly produced by macrophages, also by other
  tissues including lymphoid cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and
  neuronal tissues. TNF was identified as a soluble cytokine produced upon the activation
  by the immune system and able to exert cytotoxicity on tumor cell lines and cause
  tumor necrosis in animal models. TNF is primarily produced as a type II transmembrane
  protein arranged as stable homotrimers. The members of TNFα family exert their cellular
  effect through two distinct surface receptors of the TNF receptor family, TNFRSF1A
  (TNF-R1) and TNFRSF1B (TNF-R2). TNF-R1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas TNF-R2
  is found typically on cells of the immune system and is highly regulated. TNF-R1
  and TNF-R2 binds membrane-integrated TNF (memTNF) as well as soluble TNF (sTNF)
  TNF-R1 contains a protein-protein interaction domain, called death domain (DD).
  This domain interacts with other DD-containing proteins and couples the death receptors
  to caspase activation and apoptosis. TNF-R2 induces gene expression by a TRAF-2
  dependent signaling mechanism and also crosstalk's with TNF-R1. The pleiotropic
  biological effects of TNF can be attributed to its ability to simultaneously activate
  multiple signaling pathways in cells. Binding of TNFα to TNF-R1 on the cell surface
  triggers trimerization of the receptor and exposes intracellular domain of TNF-R1
  following the release of an inhibitory protein. This intracellular domain recruits
  a death-domain containing adaptor protein, TRADD by homophilic interactions. TRADD,
  which acts as a scaffold protein, recruits TRAF2 and RIPK1 to form a complex , referred
  to as complex 1.  Complex 1 is believed to be important in NF-κB activation and
  JNK activation. Complex 1 eventually dissociates from the receptor and integrates
  FADD and procaspase8 to form a complex referred to as the complex 2. In some cases,
  FADD/CASP8 association depends on high molecular weight complexes containing unubiquitinated
  RIPK1 as scaffold. Activated CASP8 induces CASP3 activity and execution of apoptosis.
  CASP8 activates apoptotic signal through another mechanism involving BID cleavage
  to truncated BID (tBID). tBID translocates to the mitochondria, increasing its outer
  membrane permeability. This results in cytochrome C release and activation of other
  caspases ultimately leading to apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been
  found to increase during or after complex 1 and 2 formation to mediate or potentiate
  apoptosis upon TNF stimulation. TRAF-2 in complex 1 also activates the MAP kinase
  cascade, that leads to the activation of JNK, which on prolonged activation is believed
  to mediate both apoptosis and necrotic cell death.  On complex 1 formation, NF-κB
  regulated anti-apoptotic gene products efficiently block initiation of apoptosis
  by complex 2. There is evidence of an early attempt to signal for apoptosis, which
  precedes the activation of NF-κB. The intracellular part of TNF-R1 binds to NSMAF
  which in turn mediates SMPD2-dependant ceramide production from cell membrane. Ceramide
  induces membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. This is observed before TNF-R1
  internalization and NF-κB activation. This process is repressed on TNF-R1 internalization.
  This signal however is enough to initiate apoptosis in some cells. Another form
  of cell death, necrosis, is also mediated through TNF stimulation. On TNF stimulation,
  deubiquitinated RIPK1 dissociates from complex 1 and recruits RIPK3, FADD and CASP8.
  RIPK3 is autophosphorylated and phosphorylates RIPK1. Taken together, it has been
  speculated that RIP1 and RIP3 increase carbohydrate and glutamine metabolism of
  the cell, leading to increased ROS production and eventual necrosis. Recruitment
  of CASP8, activation of FADD/RIP1 and apoptosis induction, is blunted when RIPK1
  becomes ubiquitinated. IKBKG binds to ubiquitinated RIPK1 to induce the activation
  of NF-κB, which exerts antiapoptotic effects. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis, BIRC2
  and BIRC3 has E3-ubiquitin ligase activity and functionally interact with TRAF2
  and RIPK1  to induce polyubiquitination of RIPK1 upon TNF stimulation. Loss of these
  inhibitors attenuates TNF-induced NF-κB activation. The adaptor proteins TAB2 and
  TAB3 bind preferentially to Lys-63 polyubiquitinated RIPK1. This facilitates dimerization
  of MAP3K7, promoting its phosphorylation and activation. The IKK complex, consisting
  of CHUK, IKBKB and IKBKG, is recruited to RIP1 through binding of IKBKG to the ubiquitin
  chain of RIP1. Activated TAK1 directly phosphorylates IKBKB within the activation
  loop, leading to activation of the IKK complex and NF-κB. Certain regulatory proteins
  have been known to intercept NF-κB activation at the level of ubiquitinated RIP1.
  TNFAIP3, an NF-κB inhibitory protein, removes Lys-63 polyubiquitin chain and promotes
  Lys-48 linked ubiquitination of RIPK1 leading to its degradation and NF-κB signal
  termination. IKBKG stabilizes the bound polyubiquitinated RIPK1 by inhibiting its
  degradation, most probably by impairing its interaction with TNFAIP3. OTUD7B is
  recruited to the activated TNF-R1 and promotes RIP1 deubiquitination, thereby attenuating
  NF-κB activation. At internalized TNF-receptosomes, RIPK1 is ubiquitinated by endocytic
  vesicle associated RFFL, inducing RIPK1 degradation, which terminates NF-κB activation.
  When successful, TNF-induced NF-κB activation induces transcription and expression
  of genes encoding proinflammatory IL-6, anti-apoptotic factors BIRC2, BIRC3 and
  BCL-2 homologue BCL2L1. This causes the cell to remain inert to apoptotic stimuli.  Please
