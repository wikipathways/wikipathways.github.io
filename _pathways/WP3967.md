description: Summary of findings for miR-509-3p and the YAP1/ECM axis. [Reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5041955/).
  Collectively, the results suggest that miR-509-3p-mediated changes in levels of
  YAP1 and ECM genes impair migration, invasion, and spheroid formation and so may
  attenuate metastatic progression in advanced stage ovarian cancer. Further, results
  suggest that the direct downstream miR-509-3p target YAP1 is likely a critical driver
  of cellular migration and spheroid formation in ovarian cancers in which levels
  of YAP1 protein are high.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available
  via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3967).
