description: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects 13% of Americans aged
  40 and older.  It degrades vision and, if severe, causes blindness. It is marked
  by the degeneration of photoreceptor cells and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE),
  leading to distinct atrophic areas in the macula.  Individuals with geographic atrophy
  often experience a slow and painless decline in central vision.  This makes it difficult
  to read, recognize faces, or do other tasks that need good vision.  Inspired by
  Figure 3 in [Rajanala et al. (2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11182118).
