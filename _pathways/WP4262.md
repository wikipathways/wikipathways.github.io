description: 'Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide.
  The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining
  the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland.   The molecular subtypes of breast
  cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen
  and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2),
  include:    * Luminal A subtype: Hormone receptor positive (progesterone and estrogen)
  and HER2 (ERBB2) negative   * Luminal B subtype: Hormone receptor positive (progesterone
  and estrogen) and HER2 (ERBB2) positive    * HER2 positive: Hormone receptor negative
  (progesterone and estrogen) and HER2 (ERBB2) positive   * Basal-like or triple-negative
  (TNBCs): Hormone receptor negative (progesterone and estrogen) and HER2 (ERBB2)
  negative   Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER
  pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumors, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK
  pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering
  from TNBC, the deregulation of various signaling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin),
  EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers
  are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic
  mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence
  across all breast cancers. Phosphorylation sites were added based on information
  from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.'
