description: 'This pathway is inspired by the LipidMaps, Sterol lipids expended pathway
  display (see [LipidMaps](https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps)) and extended
  with Scheme 1 from Acimovic et al. 2013. Literature suggests that cholesterol synthesis
  preferentially starts with the Bloch pathway, however there is a shift to the Kandutsch-Russell
  part via lathosterol from Bae et al, 1997. Dashed lines indicate that multiple steps
  are involved to create the final product. '
