description: 'Fatty acids are essential to all organisms except for archaea; they
  are major constituents of cellular membranes, and are used for energy storage and
  for posttranslational protein modifications. Most organisms are capable of synthesizing
  long chain (C12:0-C16:0) saturated fatty acids de novo. Although the initiation
  and termination reactions may vary, the cyclic series of chain-lengthening reactions
  are essentially the same across all organisms. The fatty acid chain, which starts
  as a 2-carbon chain from acetyl-CoA, is extended two carbons at a time by the addition
  of an acetyl group from malonyl-CoA. When the final length of the fatty acid is
  achieved, fatty acid synthesis is terminated. Each cycle of chain elongation involves
  5 reactions with the following enzymatic activities: malonyl transferase, ketoacyl
  synthase, ketoacyl reductase, 3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase, and enoyl-acyl reductase
  (EC: 1.3.1.10). In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release
  of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries
  out de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are
  the main products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small
  amounts. To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules
  are required. The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation
  of acetyl-CoA by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase). Acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase.  Description from [YeastPathways](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/).'
