description: 'Kleefstra syndrome is a rare genetic disorder (MIM #610253, Orpha:261494).
  The cause was found first to be a deletion in the region 9q34.2 with the main gene
  EHMT1, which is a histone methyltransferase and involved in epigenetics, namely
  histone methylation on histone H3 lysine residues. It also methylates DNA. Similar
  phenotypes were later found with loss of function mutations in other proteins involved
  in histone methylation, namely KMT2C (MLL3) located on 7q36.1, MBD5, SMARCB1, and
  NR1I3 (MIM #617768 Kleefstra syndrome 2).'
