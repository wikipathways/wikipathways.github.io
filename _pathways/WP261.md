description: The proteinogenic amino acid glycine can biosynthesized via several different
  pathways. The main pathway in most organisms is the production of glycine from L-serine
  via EC 2.1.2.1, glycine hydroxymethyltransferase. Eukaryotic organisms have both
  a cytosolic enzyme (SHMT2) and a mitochondrial enzyme (SHMT1) (see glycine biosynthesis
  I). The two isoforms were reported to work in opposite directions depending on the
  culture conditions. In a third pathway glycine is formed from glyoxylate, a product
  of the glyoxylate cycle, by the enzyme EC 2.6.1.44, alanine—glyoxylate transaminase
  (see glycine biosynthesis III). And finally, glycine can also be formed from L-threonine
  by the action of EC 4.1.2.48, low-specificity L-threonine aldolase (see glycine
  biosynthesis IV).  Description adapted from https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/.
