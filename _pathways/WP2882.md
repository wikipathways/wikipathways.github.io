description: In the field of molecular biology, nuclear receptors are a class of proteins
  found within cells that are responsible for sensing steroid and thyroid hormones
  and certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work with other proteins
  to regulate the expression of specific genes, thereby controlling the development,
  homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism.  Nuclear receptors have the ability
  to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these
  receptors are classified as transcription factors. The regulation of gene expression
  by nuclear receptors generally only happens when a ligand is present. More specifically,
  ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor,
  which, in turn, activates the receptor, resulting in up- or down-regulation of gene
  expression.  A unique property of nuclear receptors that differentiates them from
  other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control
  the expression of genomic DNA. As a consequence, nuclear receptors play key roles
  in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Nuclear receptors may be classified
  according to either mechanism or homology. [From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]
