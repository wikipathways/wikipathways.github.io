description: 'Hfe, the mouse equivalent of the human hemochromatosis gene, is known
  to promote expression of hepcidin, a gene product that inhibits iron absorption,
  but it is not fully clear how it does this, or at which point Hfe interacts with
  the cycle(Hfe could be acting on the interaction at points A,B, or C). Hfe, as well
  as Tmprss6, another gene product, are used in the regulation of systemic iron homeostasis.
  Evidence obtained from gene testing on mice seems to indicate that Hfe inhibits
  Tmprss6, which is known to be an inhibitor of Hjv, a gene product that augments
  BMP/SMAD signaling for the production of hepcidin. Alternatively, Hfe may promote
  Bmp/Smad signaling by HJV, or by promoting signaling at a point past where Tmprss6
  inhibits HJV. '
