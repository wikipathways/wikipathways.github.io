description: Vitamin D in inflammatory diseases.  Inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase
  pathway. Proinflammatory stimuli lead to p38MAP kinase phosphorylation and activation
  which subsequently induces expression of many proinflammatory proteins. MED14 is
  part of the mediator complex involved in the regulation of transcriptional initiation
  and it was found to form a complex with VDR and mediate ligand-dependent enhancement
  of transcription by the VDR. SMAD, NFAT and NFκB signaling and modulation of these
  signaling pathways by VDR/RXR.
