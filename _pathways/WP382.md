description: 'The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved
  module that is involved in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation,
  differentiation and migration. Mammals express at least four distinctly regulated
  groups of MAPKs, extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)-1/2, Jun amino-terminal
  kinases (JNK1/2/3), p38 proteins (p38alpha/beta/gamma/delta) and ERK5, that are
  activated by specific MAPKKs: MEK1/2 for ERK1/2, MKK3/6 for the p38, MKK4/7 (JNKK1/2)
  for the JNKs, and MEK5 for ERK5. Each MAPKK, however, can be activated by more than
  one MAPKKK, increasing the complexity and diversity of MAPK signalling. Presumably
  each MAPKKK confers responsiveness to distinct stimuli. For example, activation
  of ERK1/2 by growth factors depends on the MAPKKK c-Raf, but other MAPKKKs may activate
  ERK1/2 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli.  Description reference: [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway:map04010).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP382).  Protein
  phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R),
  www.phosphosite.org.'
