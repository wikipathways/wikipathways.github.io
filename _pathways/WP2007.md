description: During pregnancy, iron is transported from mother to fetus across the
  placenta. Iron is essential for many biological processes, including the transfer
  of oxygen in blood, but it can also be toxic. Elaborate and elegant mechanisms have
  evolved to make sure that the potential for oxidative damage is minimized. This
  description of Iron pathway through the placenta, and its regulation is purposed
  to understand the effect of Iron deficiency or Iron overload of the mother on the
  fetus.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC
  Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2007).
