  title: The differential expression of adipose tissue genes in short, medium and
    long-term periods after bariatric surgery (2024)
communities: []
description: 'This pathway is based on Figure 4 of "Origins of metastatic traits."(See
  Bibliography).The majority of cancer cells released from tumors die off, so cancer
  biologists are trying to figure out exactly what gives certain cells the ability
  to colonize other distant organs. Specific genes and mediators of metastasis have
  been identified, but it remains mostly unknown how cancer cells acquire these traits.
  Metastatic traits acquired by a quantitative gain in pathway output: These pathways
  demonstrate metastatic traits acquired by a quantitative gain in pathway output.
  The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is augmented by VCAM-1 and SRC, leads to increased
  cell survival, a significant metastatic trait. Similarly, TCF augments the output
  of the NOTCH and, along with periostin, Wnt signaling pathways. As the signaling
  of these pathways increases, the metastatic and oncogenic potential of the cell
  also increase. Metastatic traits acquired by a qualitative expansion of pathway
  output: This pathway demonstrates metastatic traits acquired by a qualitative expansion
  of pathway output. Loss of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) in renal
  cell carcinoma leads to increased activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription
  factors (HIFs). Histone H3K27 and CYTIP give the VHL-HIF pathway access to new target
  genes. Each of these new target genes, in this case CXCR4, VEGFA, and CYTIP, lead
  to an increase in a metastatic trait. Here, the level of metastatic fitness is not
  linearly proportional to pathway activity; rather, the pathway activates an additional
  set of factors that affect metastatic fitness.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3678).'
