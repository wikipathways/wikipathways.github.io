description: A proposed interactome of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), based
  on proteomics. PRC2 has histone methyltransferase activity and primarily trimethylates
  histone H3 on lysine 27, a mark of transcriptionally silent chromatin, and is required
  for initial targeting of genomic region (PRC Response Elements or PRE) to be silenced.
  Based on figure 1B in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20064376 Shen et al].
