description: Cis- and trans-acting regulators shape gene expression within the β-globin
  cluster. The LDB1 complex (LDB1/LMO2/GATA1/TAL1) binds both the locus control region
  (LCR) and globin promoters, promoting chromatin looping to activate these genes—interactions
  that may be influenced by cis-acting variants linked to HbS haplotypes. Across the
  HBB gene cluster and its surrounding regions, BCL11A and ZBTB7A (LRF) binding sites
  are present, represented by red and blue stars. Each of these transcription factors
  recruits its own NuRD complex. MYB regulates HbF expression directly and also indirectly
  through KLF1 and BCL11A. Repression of the HbF genes is indicated by dashed lines.  Inspired
  by [figure 1 in Habara et al. (2017)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5647233/).
