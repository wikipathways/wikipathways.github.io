description: The MAPK pathway involved in the progression of different diseases such
  as diabetes, developmental abnormalities and cancer since it has a essential role
  in the regulation a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation
  and apoptosis. consequently, dysregulation of MAPK pathway leads to the occurrence
  of the related disease
