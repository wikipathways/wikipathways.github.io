description: 'The Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is an anterior pituitary gonadotropin
  belonging to the family of glycoprotein hormones that includes thyroid stimulating
  hormone (TSH), Leutinizing Hormone (LH) and Chorionic Gonadotropin. FSH controls
  the growth and maturation of follicles in the females and spermatogenesis in males.
  FSH is a heterodimer and shares a common alpha sub-unit with the other glycoprotein
  hormones in its family and has a specific beta subunit that confers receptor specificity
  and biological activity to the hormone. FSH acts through the FSH receptor (FSHR),
  a G protein coupled receptor  that is expressed exclusively on the granulosa cells
  of ovaries and Sertoli cells of the testis  in humans. FSH signaling involves activation
  of adenylyl cyclase activity and the increased production of cAMP. This activates
  the cAMP dependent protein kinases such as PKA, PKB and PKC that, in turn, lead
  to the phosphorylation of specific transcription factors such as cAMP response element
  binding protein (CREB) and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1). In addition to activation
  of PI3K/Akt module, PKA also induces p38 mapk which, in turn, controls other kinase
  cascades. Activated Akt also induces the mTOR axis that stimulates mRNA translation
  by phosphorylating p70 S6 kinase and, consequently, the 40 S ribosomal protein S6
  that results in the activation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E. It also
  indirectly aids in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases
  (ERKs). FSH induces important genes required for steroidogenesis as well as growth
  and maturation of germ cells. The important target genes include aromatase (CYP19A1),
  the lutenizing hormone receptor (LHR) and the vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF).  Please access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/fsh_pathway.html)
