description: 'Nicotine is an alkaloid found in tobacco plants. It is a substance that
  acts as a stimulant in humans and is one of the main factors responsible for tobacco
  dependence. When nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the
  bloodstream, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous
  system (CNS). It binds to two main types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the
  ganglion type and the CNS type. In dopaminergic neurons in the CNS, nicotine binds
  to the CNS-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.'
