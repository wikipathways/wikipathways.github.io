description: This pathway visualises the mechanism of ophthalmate biosynthesis in
  hepatocytes. GSH can inhibits GCC; however when the cell is facing oxidative stress,
  GSH is consumed, and therefore activating GCS. This enhances the biosynthesis of
  ophthalmate, which is transported out of the cell over the hepatocellular membrane
  via MRP transporters.
