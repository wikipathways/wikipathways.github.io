description: This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Sphingolipids pathway [[1](https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps)].
  Sphingolipids are a class of lipids, which act as signal transduction and cell recognition
  molecules. This pathway provides an overview of the different tail lengths (on the
  right), which are used to convert sphinganine to DH-ceramide. All products are annotated
  with a lipid-class identifier. The integrated pathway can be found [here](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4690).
