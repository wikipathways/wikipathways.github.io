description: Scheme of mammalian tryptophan catabolism. Briefly, in mammalian cells,
  tryptophan is used mostly for protein synthesis. In a second quantitatively important
  pathway (driven by IDO in most cell types and by TDO more specifically in liver
  cells), it is the starting point of the kynurenine pathway. The kynurenine pathway
  gives birth to several metabolites, providing the appropriate enzymes that metabolize
  the various kynurenine intermediates are expressed. The main route of the kynurenine
  pathway leads to the formation of N -formyl kynurenine, L -kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine,
  3-hydroxyanthra- nilic acid, quinolinic acid, nicotinic acid, and in fine nicotinamine
  adenine dinucleotides. Additional lateral branches of the kynurenine pathway lead
  to the formation of other terminal kynurenines, such as KA, xanthurenic acid, and
  anthranilic acid. Kynurenines indicated in boldface type ( i.e. L -kynurenine and
  KA) correspond to the most abundant kynurenines found in caput epididymal tissue.
  Outside the kynurenine pathway, tryptophan is also the precursor of serotonin and
  melatonin. A very small proportion of tryptophan is also transformed into indol
  derivatives, such as indoxyl acetic acid. Conversion of Trp to N -formyl kynurenine
  is achieved via IDO and/or TDO.   The kynurenine pathway can lead to the intracellular
  NAD+ production and consumption. De novo synthesis begins with the conversion of
  tryptophan to quinolate, which is converted to NaMN. NaMN is then adenylylated to
  form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD+), which is converted to NAD+. NAD+-consuming
  enzymes break the bond between the Nam and ADP-ribosyl moieties. Nam, which is also
  provided in the diet, is salvaged to NMN, which is adenylylated to form NAD+. Na,
  which is provided in the diet and, potentially, by bacterial degradative pathways
  in vertebrates, is salvaged to form NaMN. NR, which occurs extracellularly in blood
  and milk and can be provided in the diet, is salvaged to NMN. Na and Nam are also
  converted to nicotinuric acid and N-methylnicotinamide elimination products.
