description: 'GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. It
  is synthesized from glutamate by the enzyme L-glutamic acid decarboxylase. The GABA
  transporter GAT, located in the plasma membrane of nerve terminals and glial cells,
  plays an important role in the termination of synaptic transmission. GABA enters
  the cell via GAT and is then converted to gamma hydroxybutarate or succinate, the
  latter eventually entering the citrate cycle.  There are three GABA receptors: GABA(A),
  GABA(B) and GABA(C) receptor. GABA(A) and GABA(C) receptors belong to the family
  of transmitter-gated ion channels while GABA(B) receptor is a G protein coupled
  receptor which is activated by baclofen. GABA(A) receptors are hetero-oligomeric
  Cl- channels that are modulated by barbiturates and benzodiazepines. GABA(A)R-associated
  protein (GABARAP) is localized in the golgi and plays a role in intracellular GABA
  (A) receptor transport via its ability to interact with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
  factor (NSF) and gephyrin (GPHN). Surface receptor number is important since it
  is a determinant of inhibitory synapse strength. It is controlled by removal of
  receptors from the membrane by interaction with the clathrin adaptor AP2 followed
  by recruitment into clathrin-coated pits. GABA(A) receptors can then be targeted
  for proteasomal degradation.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available
  via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4159 CPTAC Assay Portal]'
