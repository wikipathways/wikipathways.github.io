description: This pathway is based on the figure 24.1 of "In Vitro Signaling by MAPK
  and NFκB Pathways Inhibited by Yersinia YopJ" (see bibliography). In the MAPK and
  NFkB pathways, YopJ is the main inhibitor of Raf and TRAF6, NIK, or MEKK1. YopJ,
  in the NFkB pathway, may inhibit TRAF6,NIK, or MEKK.  The pathway is activated by
  the stimulus of the  genes TRAF6, NIK, or MEKK1, or the stimulus on the interactions
  between Ras to Raf. In the NFkB pathway along with the MAPK pathway, with the use
  of activators such as kinases, G-proteins, and E3 ligases, are catalysts to initiate
  of signaling cascades with a concentrated lysate.   Proteins on this pathway have
  targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3849
