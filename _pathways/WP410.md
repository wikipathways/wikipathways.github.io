  title: Hematopoietic stem-cell senescence and myocardial repair - Coronary artery
    disease genotype/phenotype analysis of post-MI myocardial regeneration response
    induced by CABG/CD133+ bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell treatment in RCT PERFECT
    Phase 3 (2020)
description: 'Human genes regulated in the diurnal comparison with orthologues that
  display circadian regulation in mouse heart and liver (Panda 2002, Storch 2002),
  and SCN (Panda 2002). The 608 significantly regulated (P < 0.05) hSkM genes identified
  in the diurnal comparison (0800 h and 2000 h) were subjected to an additional statistical
  filter of absolute fold change > 20% (n = 239) and linked to mouse circadianally
  regulated orthologues. This pathway represents the resultant 44 putative hSkM circadianally
  regulated genes; L, promoter for the light-responsive element; E, E-box (Clock/Bmal1
  promoter). Orthologue information is denoted to the left of the gene boxes: mHrts
  and mLvrs, mouse orthologue was circadianally regulated as described  (Storch 2002)
  in mouse heart or liver, respectively; mLvrp and mSCNp, mouse orthologue was diurnally
  regulated as described (Panda 2002) in mouse liver or SCN, respectively. Based on
  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14519196 Zambon et al, Genome Biol. 2003;4(10):R61].  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP410
