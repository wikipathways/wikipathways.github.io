description: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are heterogeneous group of non-enzymatic
  malliard reaction products of aldose sugar with proteins and lipids. Formation of
  AGEs is an indicator of one of the many chemical modifications of proteins and DNA
  that occur within the biological systems. Research over past two decades have implicated
  the role of AGEs in most of the age-related diseases like Alzheimer's disease, cancer,
  cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal disorders, hypertension, stroke, visual
  impairment and skin disorders. AGEs also modify the skin collagen and accelerates
  the aging process. In diabetic patients, AGE formation occurs in large scale and
  manifests with clinical symptoms such as cataract, atherosclerosis, nephropathy
  and neuropathy.  AGEs are known to bind with different cell surface receptors such
  as receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), dolichyldiphosphooligosaccharide-protein
  glycosyltransferase (AGE-R1), protein kinase C substrate, 80KH phosphoprotein (AGE-R2),
  galectin-3 (AGE-R3), and class A macrophage scavenger receptor types I and II.  RAGE,
  is the well-studied receptor for AGEs and the signaling events mediated by others
  are either not been identified or are considered as negative regulators of RAGE
  signaling. RAGE is an integral membrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
  RAGE is constituted of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a short
  cytoplasmic domain. RAGE is expressed in a wide range of tissues such as lung, heart,
  kidney, brain, skeletal muscles, and in different types of cells including endothelial
  cells, macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Besides AGEs, RAGE also
  mediate the effects of its other extracellular ligands namely extracellular high
  mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), S100 family of calcium binding proteins and amyloid-beta
  peptide, among many others. Although a large number of advanced glycation end products
  have been identified in humans, AGE/RAGE signaling ex-vivo is mostly studied using
  the AGEs such as AGE-modified albumin, N(6)(carboxymethyl)lysine, N(6)(carboxyethyl)lysine
  and pentosidine.  The signaling events mediated by RAGE are complex due to the diversity
  of its ligands and their effects in different cell types. Homodimerization of RAGE
  has been identified to be essential for RAGE signaling. Depending on the intensity
  and duration of RAGE ligation, specific signaling modules such as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK,
  CDC42/RAC, SAPK/JNK and NF-κB has been shown to be regulated in different cell types.
  AGEs have been shown to induce the formation of complexes containing RAGE with DIAPH1,
  SRC/IRS1/PKC-alpha, TIRAP/MYD88/IRAK4 and RHOA. RAGE-DIAPH1 interaction is required
  for the activation of RAC1/CDC42 pathway leading to neurite outgrowth and regulation
  of cytoskeleton.Activation of PKC-alpha through RAGE/SRC/IRS1/PKC-alpha by AGEs
  has been suggested as a mechanism of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells.
  RAGE also shares the adaptor molecules such as TIRAP, MYD88 and IRAK4 of toll-like
  receptors and induce the activation of AKT, p38MAPK and NFKB pathways. AGEs have
  also been shown to induce the formation of complex between RAGE and RHOA. RHOA/ROCK
  dependent phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) is required for the regulation
  of gap formation and actin reorganization, and thereby endothelial permeability.
  However, in tubular cells, AGEs inhibit phosphorylation of ERMs leading to inhibition
  of tubulogenesis. Similarly, AKT have been shown to be activated by AGEs and induce
  proliferation of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells where as phosphorylation
  of AKT is shown to be inhibited in podocytes leading to FOXO4 activation and apoptosis.
  The major component of AGE/RAGE signaling is the oxidative stress induced pathways.
  AGEs induce the oxidative stress through the activation of NADPH oxidases. Increased
  intracellular oxidative stress leads to stimulation of PKC and ERK1/2, resulting
  in the translocation and activation of NF-κB and subsequent up regulation of NF-κB
  dependent genes which ultimately produce deleterious effects to cells.  Please access
