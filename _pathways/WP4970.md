description: 'Galanin, a 29-30 amino acid neuropeptide named to be so, as a glycine
  residue occupies the position at N-terminal and an alanine residue at C-terminal.
  Galanin is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems in mammals. The
  galanin family of peptides includes GMAP (galanin message associated peptide), GALP
  (galanin-like peptide), and its splice variant alarin along with galanin. There
  are three known G-protein coupled receptor subtypes of galanin: GALR1, GALR2, and
  GALR3. Galaninergic signaling is predominantly inhibitory which mainly involves
  MAPK, AKT, and AC pathways. Galanin peptides have a wide range of non-neuronal functions
  as well as classic neuromodulatory roles, so they are often considered regulatory
  peptides. Galanin in general is associated with several biological functions such
  as arousal and sleep regulation, nociception, learning, inflammation, feeding, and
  neuroendocrine regulation. It is also implicated in diseases like Alzheimer''s,
  depression, epilepsy, mood disorders, stress, anxiety, diabetes mellitus, and chronic
  pain.  The creation of this pathway is described in [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33136286/
