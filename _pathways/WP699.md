description: 'Aflatoxins are naturally occurring [mycotoxins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycotoxin)
  that are produced by many species of [Aspergillus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus),
  a [fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus), most notably [Aspergillus flavus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_flavus)
  and [Aspergillus parasiticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_parasiticus).
  After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to a reactive intermediate,
  aflatoxin M<sub>1</sub>, an [epoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxide). Aflatoxin
  B1 is considered the most toxic and is produced by both Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus
  parasiticus.  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aflatoxin)  Proteins
