description: In this proposed model, H19 interacts with macroH2A, and this may consequently
  lead to de-repression of genes including CDK8, CDK4, and CCND1. Increased CDK4-cyclin
  D1 complex phosphorylates Rb to disrupt Rb-E2F1 interaction, leading to E2F1 activation.
  The increase of CDK8 expression enhances the function of mediator complex including
  MED1, and facilitates the gene regulation by beta-catenin. These downstream targets
  could work in a synergistic way of promoting cell proliferation and increasing cell
  motility in colorectal cancer. [Reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5264449/)  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3969).
