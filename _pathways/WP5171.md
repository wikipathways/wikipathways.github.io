description: 'This pathway shows an overview of leukotrienes biosynthesis and metabolism.
  Leukotrienes are a group of biologically active lipid mediators who are derived
  pre-dominantly from arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygenase pathways. This pathway
  follow two routes, one include cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4), the
  second starting at LTB4.   This pathway is linked to five disorders, out of which
  three are caused by hereditary primary defects in one enzyme also know as Inherited
  Metabolic Disorders or IMDs/IEMs (disorders depicted in pink). The clinical presentation
  of LTC4 synthase deficiency includes muscular hypotonia, psychomotor retardation,
  microcephaly and failure to thrive. The other two defects, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase
  deficiency (GGT1 protein, also know as Glutathionuria) and membrane-bound dipeptidase
  deficiency (DPEP1 protein, responsible for a wide range of dipeptides hydrolytic
  reactions), have been studied to a lesser degree. Two additional disorders can be
  linked to this pathway: an increased risk of ischemic stroke is linked to the 5-LOAP
  protein (PMID:15640973 and 14770184) and deafness (ABCC1 autosomical dominant disorder,
  found in one family, severe hearing loss as adult, the relationship between the
  phenotype and gene is provisional).  This pathway was inspired by Chapter 38 of
  the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)). '
