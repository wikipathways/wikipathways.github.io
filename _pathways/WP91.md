description: In most organisms, the primary mode of fatty acid catabolism is oxidation.
  The oxidation cycle catalyzes the complete oxidation of a fatty acid molecule, removing
  two carbon atoms (in the form of acetyl-CoA) with each turn of the cycle. The subcellular
  location in which oxidation occurs varies by organism; in bacteria, oxidation occurs
  in the cytoplasm, whereas in mammalian cells it occurs in both the mitochondria
  and the peroxisome. In contrast, oxidation in S. cerevisiae, plants, and most other
  fungi occurs exclusively in the peroxisome.  Description from [https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/
