description: Under conditions where optimal sources of nitrogen are unavailable, S.
  cerevisiae is able to utilize arginine as its sole nitrogen source. Arginine catabolism
  occurs in the cytosol with the hydrolysis of arginine to proline, releasing three
  nitrogen atoms that can be used by the cell. In the absence of oxygen, the proline
  ring is unable to be further degraded. The utilization of arginine as a nitrogen
  source is repressed if better nitrogen compounds such as ammonia, asparagine or
  glutamine are present. This is known as nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR). The
  CAR1 gene is subject to the effect of this repression which is mediated by the negative
  regulator Ure2p. In the presence of arginine and the absence of a preferred nitrogen
  source, NCR is released by the GATA transcriptional activators Gln3p and Gat1p.
  Unrelated to NCR, the presence of arginine also induces CAR1 and CAR2 expression
  by the regulators Arg80p, Arg81p and Mcm1p. The CAR genes are also activated by
  the globally acting transcription factors Rap1p and Abf1p. Conversely, CAR1 and
  CAR2 expression is repressed by the Ume6p-Sin2p-Rpd3p complex. Additionally, CAR2
  expression is induced by the two positive regulators Dal81p and Dal82p as well as
  allophanate, a degradation product of urea.  Description from [YeastPathways](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org).
