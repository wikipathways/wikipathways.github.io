description: 'IL-9 is a multifunctional cytokine, belong to a family of cytokines.
  IL-9 was initially reported as a T cell growth factor in mice. It is now known to
  target multiple cell types. It plays an important role in the expansion and recruitment
  of mast cells in response to intestinal nematode infection or during autoimmune
  encephalomyelitis. It is also known to act on various cell types known to be involved
  in asthma including T cells, B cells, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and
  epithelial cells. IL 9 can promote the expression of TGF-beta in lipopolysaccharide
  induced monocytes and macrophages. IL-9 is also known to play important roles in
  conditions including airway inflammation, EAE and parasitic infections. Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathway is activated transiently by IL-9, which in turn leads to
  the growth stimulation of hematopoietic cell lines. IL-9 signals through the heterodimeric
  receptor composed of a specific chain (IL-9R) and a gamma chain (IL2RG), which is
  shared between IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL15 and IL-21. The IL-9R and IL-2RG associates
  with JAK1 and JAK3 respectively. Receptor engagement results in JAK1- JAK3 cross
  phosphorylation and activation of the JAK proteins which leads to the activation
  of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT-1, STAT-3 and STAT-5)
  and Insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS1 and IRS2)/PI3K cascades. IL-9 stimulation
  also results in the activation of MEK/ERK signaling cascade.  Please access this
