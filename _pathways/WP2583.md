  title: DNA methylation of ARHGAP30 is negatively associated with ARHGAP30 expression
    in lung adenocarcinoma, which reduces tumor immunity and is detrimental to patient
    survival (2021)
description: The activation and translocation of transcription factors NFAT, AP-1
  and NF-kappa-B via the co-stimulatory signaling cascade triggered by MHC peptide,
  B7 proteins and PD-L1. The activation of NFAT involves a Ca2+/calcineurin disruption
  of a massive RNA-protein complex prior to its translocation into the nucleus and
  ultimate transcription factor activity.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2583
  CPTAC Assay Portal].
