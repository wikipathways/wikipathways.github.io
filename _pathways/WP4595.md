description: 'The urea cycle converts toxic nitrogenous compounds to excretable urea
  in five biochemical reactions. It is also the source for endogenous arginine, ornithine
  and citrulline production. The process mainly takes place in the liver, partly in
  the mitochondria and partly in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes. There are several
  pathways associated with  the urea cycle and with the associated disorders, parts
  of these pathways are also pictured here.   Because there is no alternative way
  to convert toxic nitrogenous compounds, defects in the enzymes or transporters can
  lead to several diseases (diseases highlighted in pink). The diseases are characterised
  by hyperammonemia, respiratory alkalosis and encephalopathy and the severity of
  the disease depends on the severity of the defect and the place of the defect in
  the cycle. Severe forms usually have an onset in infancy, while mild forms can also
  present in adulthood.  This pathway was inspired by Chapter 4 of the book of Blau
  (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).  For the Urea cycle without additional pathways
  see: [WP4571](https://wikipathways.org/pathways/WP4571)'
