  title: Chronic inflammatory arthritis drives systemic changes in circadian energy
    metabolism (2022)
description: 'Inflammatory immune response requires the recruitment of leukocytes
  to the site of inflammation upon foreign insult. Chemokines are small chemoattractant
  peptides that provide directional cues for the cell trafficking and thus are vital
  for protective host response. In addition, chemokines regulate plethora of biological
  processes of hematopoietic cells to lead cellular activation, differentiation and
  survival. The chemokine signal is transduced by chemokine receptors (G-protein coupled
  receptors) expressed on the immune cells. After receptor activation, the alpha-
  and beta-gamma-subunits of G protein dissociate to activate diverse downstream pathways
  resulting in cellular polarization and actin reorganization. Various members of
  small GTPases are involved in this process. Induction of nitric oxide and production
  of reactive oxygen species are as well regulated by chemokine signal via calcium
  mobilization and diacylglycerol production. Source: [http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway:map04062
