description: The pathways hypothesized to be involved in cardiovascular diseases begin
  with LTBPs and fibrillins activating a TGFBR complex. The complex can begin the
  canonical TGFB pathway involving SMAD proteins that target gene expression for proteins
  involved in endocardial and epicardial EMT, neural crest migration, ECM remodeling,
  cell differentiation, development and maintenance of cardiovascular structure and
  function. The non-canonical TGFB pathway involves the calcium-calneurin signaling
  pathway that also affects those functions. The TGFBR complex also activates SHCA
  and Tak1, which promote the function of a complex (ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38) to regulate
  the previously mentioned cell functions and influence the development of cardiovascular
  diseases. These diseases are additionally influenced by a signaling pathway involving
  the activation of TGFB ligands, receptors, activators, and effectors by ANG2/AT1/2R
  complex. This pathway is based on figure 1 from Doetschman et al.   Proteins on
  this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3668).
