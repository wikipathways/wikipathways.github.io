description: Proposed model for regulation of MSMP expression in cancer cells under
  hypoxic conditions and the proangiogenic role of MSMP in ovarian tumors.  The recruitment
  of the transcriptional repressor CTCF to the MSMP enhancer region is regulated by
  changes in H3 acetylation of the MSMP enhancer. In hypoxic conditions, the repressor-enhancer
  binding is disrupted, leading to increased expression of MSMP. Secretion of MSMP
  triggers MAPK signaling in endothelial cells (presumably via CCR2 signaling), which
  promotes angiogenesis.   This suggests that MSMP inhibition in combination with
  antiangiogenesis drugs (anti-VEGF) could be a new strategy to overcome resistance
  to antiangiogenesis therapy.  Description adapted from Mitamura et al.
