description: 'Integrins are cell surface heterodimeric protein complex consisting
  of one alpha and one beta chain. Integrins act as cell adhesion molecules as well
  as participate in cellular signaling. The ligands of the alpha6 beta4 integrin are
  heterotrimers belonging to the laminin family including Laminin A2, Laminin B1,
  Laminin C1, Laminin A3, Laminin B3, Laminin C2, Laminin A5, Laminin A1 and Laminin
  B2 among others. Upon activation, the receptor is phosphorylated and associates
  with adaptor molecules Shc and Grb2, which then activate the PI 3-kinase/Akt, MAPK/NFkB
  and SMAD signaling modules.  Source: NetPath http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_1'
