description: 'Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 85% of lung cancer and
  is defined as any type of epithelial lung cancer that is NOT small cell carcinoma,
  including squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma.  Mutations in
  NSCLC:  * KRAS (mutated in ~29% of NSCLC patients) inactivates its GTPase activity
  and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus.  *
  Mutations or overexpression of EGFR (~22% of NSCLC patients) leads to increased
  proliferation.  * The abnormal fusion of EML4-ALK (~5% of NSCLC patients) leads
  to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition
  of apoptosis.  * Inactivating mutation of p53 (~50% of NSCLC patients) leads to
  reduced apoptosis and proliferation.  * The protein encoded by the p16INK4a, CDKN2A,
  inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and
  CDK6. p16INK4a is mutated in ~12% of NSCLC patients, which leads to a loss of this
  inhibitory effect. * RARB is a nuclear retinoic acid receptor whose function is
  often lost in NSCLC, leading to a loss of cell growth control.'
