description: '"Mechanisms of action of bempedoic acid. In the cytoplasm of hepatocytes,
  ACSVL1 converts bempedoic acid to bempedoyl-CoA that directly inhibits ACLY. This
  is a key enzyme responsible for generating acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate from citric
  acid deriving from mitochondrial TCA cycle. Reduction of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate
  levels affects fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis as well as gluconeogenesis.
  In addition, bempedoic free acid activates the AMPK pathway, which downregulates
  key rate-limiting enzymes of lipid synthesis (ACC and HMGR) and glucose production
  (PEPCK and G6Pase). In the liver, the combination of ACLY inhibition and AMPK activation
  by bempedoic acid decreases cholesterol, FFA and glucose synthesis both by reducing
  precursor substrates and by downregulating key enzyme activities. Through this mechanism,
  bempedoic acid may improve dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and diabetes. In skeletal
  muscle, bempedoic acid cannot be activated to bempedoyl-CoA because ACSVL1 is completely
  absent in this tissue. Thus, this drug does not promote myotoxicity associated with
  cholesterol synthesis inhibition, as statins can. In the immune cells and in other
  tissues, AMPK activation by bempedoic acid downregulates MAPK pro-inflammatory pathways
  leading to decreased cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule synthesis. Through
  this mechanism, bempedoic acid decreases inflammation, hsCRP levels and may contribute
  to atherosclerosis and NASH prevention. Red T indicate inhibition; green arrow indicates
  activation; blue arrows indicate clinical targets. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; ACLY,
  ATP-citrate lyase; ACSVL1, very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1; AMPK, AMP-activated
