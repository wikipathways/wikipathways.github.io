description: The complement activation takes place through one or more of the well-established
  (alternative, classical or lectin) pathways consisting of plasma and membrane-bound
  proteins. All three pathways converge at the level of complement C3 [https://doi.org/10.6072/H0.MP.A004235.01]
  and are controlled by regulators [https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.1923]. Complement C3
  belongs to the alpha-2-macroglobulin family of proteins, and consists of a alpha-chain
  and an beta-chain. Cleavage of C3 which can be initiated by one or more of the above
  three distinct pathways, into C3b[Proteolysis@23-667,749-1663] and C3a [Proteolysis@672-748]
  is an important step in the complement activation cascade. Classical and lectin
  pathways, when activated with recognition of pathogens (or immune complexes) use
  C3-convertase [C4b2a] to cleave complement C3 into C3a and C3b [https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.125.2.359].
  However, in alternative pathway a small fraction of the C3 molecules are hydrolyzed
  to C3(H20) exposing new binding sites. This hydrated C3 [C3(H20)] recruits complement
  factor B [fB], which is then cleaved by complement factor D [fD] to result in formation
  of the minor form of C3-convertase [C3(H20)Bb] that cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b
  [https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.154.3.856]. Further, addition of C3b to C3 convertase
  [C3bBb or C4b2a] results in C5 convertase [C3bBb3b or C4b2a3b], that cleaves complement
  C5 to C5a and C5b, is the last enzymatic step of the complement activation cascade
  [https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.273.27.16828][https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2387864].
  During complement activation C5b interacts with complement C6, C7, C8 and C9 in
  a sequential and non-catalyzed manner to result in the formation of Terminal Complement
  Complex (TCC) [https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111.219766]. The entire network is considered
  as a simple recognition and elimination system of host-immune complexes and apoptotic
  and/or pathogens, and therefore promotes host immune homeostasis. The complement
  system is also involved in cross-talk with other processes related to coagulation,
  lipid metabolism and cancer. However, many pathogens counteract complement attack
  through a range of different mechanisms, such acquisition of host complement regulators
  to the surface of pathogen, or secretion of complement inactivation factors. In
  order to have a holistic view of the entire complement network, Dr. John D.Lambris
  group (University of Pennsylvania) developed the Complement Map Database (CMAP)
  which is a unique repository focused on documented molecular interactions described
  within the complement cascade and between complement and other biological systems.
  Information contained in CMAP (http://www.complement.us/cmap/index.php)[https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt269]
  is entirely based on published experimental data and is fully revised by experts
  in the field. Further, the Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages -SGMP-( https://escholarship.org/uc/molecule_pages)[https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btr190]
  has published a curated data on each protein involved in human complement activation
