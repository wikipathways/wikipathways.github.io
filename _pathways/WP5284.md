description: The molecular interactions of different cells in the pancreatic cancer
  tumor microenvironment (TME). Pancreatic cancer cells have developed various ways
  of evading and manipulating the immune system, and the TME plays an essential role
  in this. Various molecular interactions are involved in the interactions between
  cells in the TME.
