description: 'KCNQ gene mutations are a common source for genetically caused epilepsies.
  KCNQ genes code for Kv7 subunits, which are required for Kv7 channels in the brain.
  These channels, also known as the M channels, are required for an outward potassium
  flow, known as the M current. Mutations in KCNQ genes and genes associated with
  Kv7 channel function can result in the impairment of this potassium flow. This leads
  to a constant state of depolarization in the neuron cells, which leads to increased
  excitabilty and a constant firing of action potentials, resulting in types of epilepsy. '
