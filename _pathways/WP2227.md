description: The heterochronic pathway, regulating larval development in Caenorhabditis
  elegans, is shown. Caenorhabditis elegans is a good model for studying heterochronic
  genes,due to its invariant cell lineages.  Heterochronic is associated with the
  development of cells or tissues at a "different" time relative to other developmental
  events. Changes in developmental timing are thought to be a driving force of morphological
  evolution.   Regulatory relationships shown here are supported by genetic data,
  but not all are direct.  Lin-42 is not shown, as its complex expression pattern
  and genetic interactions suggest that it acts at multiple steps through out the
  pathways, making its precise placement difficult. In the absence of ligand DAF-12
  represses let-7 family miRNAs.  Arrows indicate activation - Bars indicate repression.
