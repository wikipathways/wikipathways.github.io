description: 'Programmed cell death: regulated necrosis. During regulated necrosis,
  different stimuli are recognized or sensed by specific receptors on the cell surface
  or inside cells. The activation of the necrosome stimulates different signaling
  pathways leading to mitochondrial hyperpolarization, lysosomal membrane permeabilization,
  and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cellular disintegration.
  A recent study revealed that germanium nanoparticles trigger necrostatin-1-inhibitable
  cell death with a reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential.   Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2513
