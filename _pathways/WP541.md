description: Most organisms synthesize NAD+ from simple components. The specific set
  of reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of
  quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid – either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and
  some bacteria, or aspartic acid (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic
  acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose
  moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide
  (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide
  (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.  Description adapted from
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide).
