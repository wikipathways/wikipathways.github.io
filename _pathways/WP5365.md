description: The Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by a microdeletion
  in the chromosomal region 4p16.3. Typical symptoms are a distinct facial morphology,
  intellectual disability, psychiatric disorders, seizures, and heart defects. The
  chromosomal position chr4:1,552,030-2,091,303 (GCRh37) was taken from Kirov et al.
  2014 and literature cited there (10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.07.022).
