description: This pathway is based on the Figure 7 of "Cadherin 6 Is a New RUNX2 Target
  in TGF-β Signalling Pathway" (see bibliography). TGF-B is a target gene in thyroid
  cells in the causation of cancer. When TGF-B is activated, the pathway can take
  2 directions, through a SMAD pathway or a Non-Smad pathway. Through the SMAD pathway,
  SMAD separates into SMAD2/3, SMAD4, and involves phosphates into the nuclear signalling.
  Through the Non-SMAD pathway, the activation of MAPK and Pi3k  causes the activation
  of ERK, AKT and phosphates, and then into the nuclear signalling. Within the nuclear
  signalling, EMT-TF has two responses, early and late. With the early response, EMT-TF
  signals to Id1 and RUNX2, and with the late response, EMT-TF signals to Snai1 and
  Snai2. Depending on the response also dictates the type of marker that will follow.
  If early, N-CAD,FN1,VIM,TNC, and CDH6 all cause the activation of the Mesenchymal
  markers. If late, E-CAD, and CDH16 cause the inhibition of the Epithelial Markers.    Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3859
