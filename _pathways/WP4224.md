description: 'Overview of purine metabolism and related diseases. Disorders resulting
  from an enzyme defect are highlighted in pink, metabolic markers are highlighted
  in red. Arrows indicate the directionality of chemical conversions.  On the right,
  the biosynthesis of IMP is depicted in more detail (adapted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purine_metabolism).
  The color scheme for this part of the pathway is as follows: enzymes (black), coenzymes
  (light orange), regular substrates/metabolites (blue), additional substrates (dark
  green), metal ions(turquoise), inorganic molecules (light purple).  This pathway
  was inspired by Ed. 5, Chapter 13 from the book of Blau (Ed. 4 Chapter 41) (ISBN
  9783030677268). A similar version without the disorders and with biomarkers visualised
  with arrows can be found [here](https://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP4792).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available vH₂Oia the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4224)'
