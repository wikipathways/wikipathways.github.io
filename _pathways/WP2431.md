description: This pathway provides an overview of cell types, therapeutic targets,
  drugs, new proposed targets and pathways implicated in spinal cord injury. Spinal
  cord injury is a complex multistep process that involves the regulation of gene
  expression and signaling in motor neurons, oligodentrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes
  that trigger immediate immune responses lasting several weeks. Within 24 hours,
  chemoattractants  and cytokines released from the site of injury activate neutrophils
  which further recruit B and T cells or recruit monocytes that ultimately result
  in infiltration and activation by microglia and macrophages. These immune responses
  result in inflammation, excitotoxicity, cell death, formation of glial scar, and
  suppression of axonal regeneration. An increase in the expression of cell cycle
  genes further results in proliferation of astrocytes and microglia that leads to
  apoptosis and necrosis of oligodentrocytes and neurons. An example therapy is the
  administration of the immunosuppressant FK506, also used in transplantation to offer
  neuroprotection.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the
  [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2431 CPTAC Assay Portal].
