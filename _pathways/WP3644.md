description: NAD+ metabolism in different cellular compartments. The different precursors
  to intracellular NAD metabolism - tryptophan, nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide,
  NR, and NMN - are shown, along with their extra-cellular metabolism by CD38 and
  CD73. The cytoplasmic and nuclear NAD+ pools probably equilibrate by diffusion through
  the nuclear pore. However, the mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to both NAD+
  and NADH. Reducing equivalents generated by glycolysis are transferred to the mitochondrial
  matrix via the malate/aspartate shuttle and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate shuttle.
  The resulting mitochondrial NADH (malate/aspartate shuttle) is oxidized by complex
  I in the electron transport chain, whereas the resulting FADH2 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  shuttle) is oxidized by complex II. In each of the three compartments, different
  NAD+-consuming enzymes lead to the generation of nicotinamide, which is recycled
  via the NAD+ salvage pathway. Different forms of the NMNAT enzyme and sirtuins are
  localized in different compartments. The nature of the salvage pathway for NAD+
  in mitochondria has not been fully resolved, although NMNAT3 has been found in mitochondria.   Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3644).
