description: The process of RNA-interference in eukaryotic cells. Long precursor microRNA
  (miRNA), called pri-miRNA, is cleaved by RNase III endonuclease (Drosha) into pieces
  of approximately 70 nucleotides each (called pre-miRNA) in the nucleus. Following
  transportation into the cytoplasm by exportin 5 another RNase III endonuclease (Dicer)
  cleaves it into mature miRNA segments. Degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and translational
  repression occurs after miRNA binds to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).
  Cytoplasmic long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is cleaved by Dicer into small interfering
  RNA (siRNA), which is incorporated into RISC, resulting in the cleavage and degradation
  of specific target mRNA. Synthetic double-stranded siRNA is not processed by Dicer
  and directly incorporated by the RISC.  After cleavage by Dicer, mature miRNAs can
  also be released out of cells in exosomes, microvesicles or apoptotic bodies, or
  bond to some high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and Argonaute protein 2 (Ago2). Viral
  miRNAs exported from the nucleus are processed in the same way.  Proteins on this
  pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2805).
