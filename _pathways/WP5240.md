description: Lac-Phe is formed by Cndp2 and exported outside the cell, into the blood
  circulation by Abcc5. It is linked to food intake and obesity, where it is increased
  after exercise and suppresses food intake.   Homology converted from [WP5239](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5239).
