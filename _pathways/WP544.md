description: 'Time- and exercise-dependent gene regulation in human skeletal muscle,
  http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/10/R61  Mouse genes regulated in the diurnal (inferred
  from human) and compared with mouse genes that display circadian regulation in mouse
  heart and liver (Panda 2002, Storch 2002), and SCN (Panda 2002). The 608 significantly
  regulated (P < 0.05) hSkM genes identified in the diurnal comparison (0800 h and
  2000 h) were subjected to an additional statistical filter of absolute fold change
  > 20% (n = 239) and linked to mouse circadianly regulated orthologues. This pathway
  represents the resultant 44 putative hSkM circadianly regulated genes; L, promoter
  for the light-responsive element; E, E-box (Clock/Bmal1 promoter). Orthologue information
  is denoted to the left of the gene boxes: mHrts and mLvrs, mouse orthologue was
  circadianly regulated as described (Storch 2002) in mouse heart or liver, respectively;
  mLvrp and mSCNp, mouse orthologue was diurnally regulated as described (Panda 2002)
  in mouse liver or SCN, respectively.'
