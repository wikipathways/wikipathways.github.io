description: The malate-aspartate shuttle (sometimes also the malate shuttle) is a
  biochemical system for translocating electrons produced during glycolysis across
  the semipermeable inner membrane of the mitochondrion for oxidative phosphorylation
  in eukaryotes. These electrons enter the electron transport chain of the mitochondria
  via reduction equivalents to generate ATP. The shuttle system is required because
  the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to NADH, the primary reducing equivalent
  of the electron transport chain. To circumvent this, malate carries the reducing
  equivalents across the membrane. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malate-aspartate_shuttle
