description: This pathway shows an simplified version of the Krebs cycle (for more
  details see [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP78] ), with 4 genetic
  diseases related to it. For succinyl-CoA synthetase deficiencies, relevant metabolic
  markers are depicted in light green. Patients with a mutation in the SUCLG1 might
  present a severe (fatal) form of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy.  This pathway
  was inspired by Chapter 20 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
