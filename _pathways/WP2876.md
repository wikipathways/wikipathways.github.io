  title: 'Identifying Drug-Induced Liver Injury Associated With Inflammation-Drug
    and Drug-Drug Interactions in Pharmacologic Treatments for COVID-19 by Bioinformatics
    and System Biology Analyses: The Role of Pregnane X Receptor (2022)'
description: The Pregnane X receptor (PXR, a.k.a. NR1I2) is a nuclear receptor whose
  primary function is sensing xenobiotics. It regulates the gene expression of genes
  that encode proteins involved in detoxification and clearance of xenobiotics.    Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2876
