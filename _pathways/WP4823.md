description: Kidneys develop from intermediate mesoderm under the timed or sequential
  control of a growing number of genes. These genes have been identified at various
  stages of glomerulotubular development in the mammalian kidney. The genes listed
  have been tested in various genetically modified mice, and their location corresponds
  to the classical stages of kidney development postulated by Saxen in 1987.
