description: In vascular smooth muscle, caffeine promotes relaxation by inhibiting
  myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) through cAMP elevation and activating myosin light-chain
  phosphatase (MLCP), reducing myosin–actin interaction.  As a nonselective adenosine
  receptor antagonist, caffeine blocks A₁/A₃ receptors (which normally lower cAMP)
  and A₂A/A₂B receptors (which normally raise cAMP), thereby altering adenylate cyclase
  activity.  In endothelial cells, caffeine increases intracellular Ca²⁺, activating
  eNOS to produce nitric oxide (NO), which diffuses to smooth muscle and stimulates
  cGMP signaling, further promoting vasodilation.  Inspired by [Figure 1 in Kumar
  and Lipshultz, 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6915633).
