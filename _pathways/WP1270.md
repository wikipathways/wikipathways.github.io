description: Endochondral ossification is the process by which the embryonic cartilaginous
  model of most bones contributes to longitudinal growth and is gradually replaced
  by bone. During endochondral ossification, chondrocytes proliferate, undergo hypertrophy
  and die; the cartilage extracellular matrix they construct is then invaded by blood
  vessels, osteoclasts, bone marrow cells and osteoblasts, the last of which deposit
  bone on remnants of cartilage matrix. The sequential changes in chondrocyte behaviour
  are tightly regulated by both systemic factors and locally secreted factors, which
  act on receptors to effect intracellular signalling and activation of chondrocyte-selective
  transcription factors. Systemic factors that regulate the behaviour of chondrocytes
  in growth cartilage include growth hormone and thyroid hormone, and the local secreted
  factors include Indian hedgehog, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, fibroblast
  growth factors and components of the cartilage extracellular matrix. Transcription
  factors that play critical roles in regulation of chondrocyte gene expression under
  the control of these extracellular factors include Runx2, Sox9 and MEF2C. The invasion
  of cartilage matrix by the ossification front is dependent on its resorption by
  members of the matrix metalloproteinase family, as well as the presence of blood
  vessels and bone-resorbing osteoclast (Mackie et al.)
