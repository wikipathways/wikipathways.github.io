description: 'Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role
  in the innate immune system. They are single, membrane-spanning, non-catalytic receptors
  usually expressed in sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that
  recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes. Once these microbes
  have breached physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they
  are recognized by TLRs, which activate immune cell responses. The TLRs include TLR1,
  TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13.
  TLR signaling is divided into two distinct signaling pathways, the MyD88-dependent
  and TRIF-dependent pathway.  The MyD88-dependent response occurs on dimerization
  of the TLR receptor, and is utilized by every TLR except TLR3. Its primary effect
  is activation of NFκB and Mitogen-activated protein kinase. Ligand binding and conformational
  change that occurs in the receptor recruits the adaptor protein MyD88, a member
  of the TIR family. MyD88 then recruits IRAK4, IRAK1 and IRAK2. IRAK kinases then
  phosphorylate and activate the protein TRAF6, which in turn polyubiquinates the
  protein TAK1, as well as itself in order to facilitate binding to IKK-β. On binding,
  TAK1 phosphorylates IKK-β, which then phosphorylates IκB causing its degradation
  and allowing NFκB to diffuse into the cell nucleus and activate transcription and
  consequent induction of inflammatory cytokines. Both TLR3 and TLR4 utilize the TRIF-dependent
  pathway, which is triggered by dsRNA and LPS, respectively. For TLR3, dsRNA leads
  to activation of the receptor, recruiting the adaptor TRIF. TRIF activates the kinases
  TBK1 and RIPK1, which creates a branch in the signaling pathway. The TRIF/TBK1 signaling
  complex phosphorylates IRF3 allowing its translocation into the nucleus and production
  of Interferon type I. Meanwhile, activation of RIPK1 causes the polyubiquitination
  and activation of TAK1 and NFκB transcription in the same manner as the MyD88-dependent
  pathway. Source: Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor#Signaling)'
