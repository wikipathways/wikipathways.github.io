description: 'The first five steps of arginine biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae take
  place in the mitochondrion (CITS: [11553611])(CITS: [Hinnebusch]). This part of
  the pathway is known as the acetylated derivatives cycle because the acetyl group
  that is added to L-glutamate in the first step of the pathway is recycled via N-acetylglutamate
  generated in the fifth step. The enzymes that catalyze the second and third steps
  are encoded by a single gene (ARG5,6) that is translated into a pre-protein which
  is imported into mitochondria and cleaved there to yield two enzymes, N-acetylglutamate
  kinase and N-acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase (CITS: [1649049]). These enzymes
  form a complex with each other and with N-acetylglutamate synthase, the first enzyme
  in the pathway, which may have implications for regulation of their activity (CITS:
  [11553611]).  The mitochondrial steps of the arginine biosynthesis pathway result
  in the formation of ornithine, which is exported to the cytoplasm by the transporter
  Ort1p (CITS: [8798783]). In the cytoplasm, L-ornithine is converted to L-arginine
  in three reactions mediated by ornithine carbamoyltransferase, arginosuccinate synthase,
  and argininosuccinate lyase.  Transcription of genes of the arginine biosynthetic
  pathway, as well as of other amino acid biosynthetic pathways, is activated by the
  transcription factor Gcn4p under conditions of amino acid starvation (CITS: [11390663])(CITS:
  [Hinnebusch]). Transcription of ARG1, ARG3, ARG5,6, and ARG8 is also repressed in
  the presence of arginine by the ArgR/Mcm1p complex, which consists of Arg80p, Arg81p,
  Arg82p, and Mcm1p (CITS: [14563547]). The transcriptional activator Gcn4p interacts
  with subunits of the ArgR/Mcm1p repressor, allowing for fine-tuning of transcriptional
  control in response to arginine availability (CITS: [15289616]).  SOURCE: SGD pathways,
