description: Overview of pyrimidine metabolism and related diseases. Pyrimidine metabolism
  is important for the synthesis of thymine, cytosine and uracil, some of the building
  blocks for DNA and RNA and they also have functions in signal transduction and energy
  transport. The pathway can be split up in 3 parts, one is the de novo synthesis
  of pyrimidines, starting with glutamine and ending at UMP. From here the UMP can
  either be used in the nucleic acid synthesis (up) or broken down to Beta-alanine
  or (S)-beta-aminoisobutyrate. Disorders in the metabolism of pyrimidine are mostly
  caused by enzyme defects (highlighted in pink, one disease is depicted in orange,
  since there appears to be no clinical difference between type 2 and 1 of orotic
  aciduria, therefore researchers believe that type 2 does not exist officially).
  The clinical presentation of pyrimidine disorders is very diverse, because of the
  diversity in biological function. The severity of the disorder is determined by
  the severity of the defect and the function of the normal enzyme.   Metabolic markers
  are highlighted in dark purple. Complexes mentioned in pathway are pictured in bottom
  left corner. The link to the Urea cycle is depicted for clarity.  This pathway was
  inspired by Chapter 41 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
