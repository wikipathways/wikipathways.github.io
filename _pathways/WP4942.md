description: 'This pathway shows the genes deleted or duplicated in 15q13.3 copy number
  variation syndrome. The affected region is between 30,500,000-32,500,000 bp on Chromosome
  15. The major genes in this region are OTUD7A and CHRNA7 which are known influencers
  of neuronal development and function. For several genes in this regio there are
  no exact functions known yet - e.g. the GOLGA gene group or the MTMR10 which is
  similar to phosphatidyl-inositol 3 phosphatases but without an active catalytic
  centre. The breakpoints 30,500,000-32,500,000 are from "15q13.3 Microdeletion",
