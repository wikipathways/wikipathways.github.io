description: Trehalose is a storage carbohydrate that can either be synthesized or
  obtained from the external environment. To be utilized as a carbon source, trehalase
  (EC:3.2.1.28) must convert trehalose and water into two molecules of glucose. S.
  cerevisiae has two trehalase enzymes, one is an acid trehalase encoded by ATH1 and
  the other is a neutral trehalase encoded by NTH1. The name "acid" or "neutral" are
  based on the optimal pH of each enzyme (pH 4.5-5.0 and pH 6.8-7.0, respectively).
