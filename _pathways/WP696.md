  title: Proteostasis regulators modulate proteasomal activity and gene expression
    to attenuate multiple phenotypes in Fabry disease (2020)
description: Benzene metabolism primarily takes place in the liver, to a variety of
  products that are transported to the bone marrow where additional metabolism occurs.
  Several metabolites of benzene are responsible for the toxic effects of benzene
  including reactive metabolites that covalently bind macromolecules and induce oxidative
  damage.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP696
