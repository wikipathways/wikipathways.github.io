description: Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a pathway that repairs double-strand
  breaks in DNA. NHEJ is referred to as "non-homologous" because the break ends are
  directly ligated without the need for a homologous template, in contrast to homologous
  recombination, which requires a homologous sequence to guide repair. NHEJ involves
  binding of the KU heterodimer to double-stranded DNA ends, recruitment of DNA-PKcs
  (MRX complex in yeast), processing of ends, and recruitment of the DNA ligase IV
  (LIG4)-XRCC4 complex, which brings about ligation.  NHEJ typically utilizes short
  homologous DNA sequences called microhomologies to guide repair. These microhomologies
  are often present in single-stranded overhangs on the ends of double-strand breaks.
  When the overhangs are perfectly compatible, NHEJ usually repairs the break accurately.
  Imprecise repair leading to loss of nucleotides can also occur, but is much more
  common when the overhangs are not compatible. Inappropriate NHEJ can lead to translocations
  and telomere fusion, hallmarks of tumor cells. NHEJ is evolutionarily conserved
  throughout all kingdoms of life and is the predominant double-strand break repair
  pathway in mammalian cells.  Adapted from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-homologous_end_joining
