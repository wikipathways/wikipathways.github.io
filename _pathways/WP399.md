description: This pathway was adapted from several resources and is designed to provide
  a theoretical framework to examine Wnt signaling and interacting components in the
  context of embryonic stem-cell pluripotency and self-renewal.  A central organizing
  theme of this pathway is known drug targets that promote self-renewal or pluripotency
  (BIO and IQ-1)  and implicated upstream regulators of the core pluripotency transcriptional
  components (e.g. Nanog).  It is unclear whether all the depicted components participate
  in this pathway in human embryonic stem cells.  Interactions and object/gene groups
  for the pathway exist for the majority of components.  Proteins on this pathway
  have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP399).
