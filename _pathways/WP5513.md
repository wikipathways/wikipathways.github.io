description: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work by inhibiting the
  cyclooxygenase enzymes PTGS1 (COX-1) and PTGS2 (COX-2), with different NSAIDs showing
  varying selectivity for the COX-2 isoform.  This inhibition blocks the conversion
  of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins (PGs).  Inspired by Figure 1 in PMID:32322101.
