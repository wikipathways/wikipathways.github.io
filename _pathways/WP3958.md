description: G-protein-coupled receptor GPR40 (also known as Free fatty acid receptor
  1, FFAR1) is a seven trans-membrane domain receptor which is predominantly expressed
  in pancreatic beta cells. It plays an essential role in fatty acid amplification
  of glucose-induced insulin secretion. GPR40 agonists are in second phase of preclinical
  trials for treatment of diabetes because of their role in improved glucose control.    Binding
  of free fatty acids to GPR40 initiates a downstream signaling cascade which involves
  activation of a transducer protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-11
  (GNA11). Next, phospholipase C (PLC) hormone is activated.  This hydrolyzes membrane
  phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol-4-5-biphosphate into second messenger
  molecules inositol-1-4-5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).   IP3 initiates
  calcium efflux from endoplasmic reticulum and increase intracellular calcium concentration.  Increased
  intracellular calcium concentration is involved in activating the insulin exocytosis
  machinery. DAG on the other hand activates PKD1. PKD1 initiates F-actin remodeling
  and supports the second phase of insulin exocytosis.
