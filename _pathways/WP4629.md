description: 'Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into
  pyruvate, CH3COCOO- and H+. The free energy released in this process is used to
  form the ATP and NADH. This pathway was made during a research project at the UMCG,
  concerning changed glycolytic fluxes during the Warburg Effect. It is an extended
  version of the glycolysis pathway (WP534), and is descriptive of the content that
  is provided in the computer model of Shestov et al (2014). A second version, containing
  the content of the model itself as well as the corresponding supplement and article,
  can be found here [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4628]  This
  pathway was uploaded to provide a high resolution version to readers of the thesis.
