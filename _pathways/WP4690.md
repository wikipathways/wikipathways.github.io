description: This pathway is inspired by the [Lipidmaps>Sphingolipids pathway (all
  chain lengths)](https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps). Sphingolipids are
  a class of lipids, which act as signal transduction and cell recognition molecules.
  This pathway shows all different tail lengths and their conversions into specific
  products. All products are annotated with lipid-specific identifiers (if available).
  The general overview pathway can be found [here](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4344).
