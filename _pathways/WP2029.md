description: miRNAs regulation of differentiation of numerous cell types.  This diagram
  shows progressive commitment and subsequent differentiation of various lineages
  from pluripotent stem cells. Some examples of the influence by miRNAs on specific
  cell fates are shown. The pathway is based on [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20621048
  Fig 2 from Ivey and Srivastava].   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays
  available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2029 CPTAC
  Assay Portal]
