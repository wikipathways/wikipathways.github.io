description: miRNAs regulation of differentiation of numerous cell types.  This diagram
  shows progressive commitment and subsequent differentiation of various lineages
  from pluripotent stem cells. Some examples of the influence by miRNAs on specific
  cell fates are shown. The pathway is based on [Fig 2 from Ivey and Srivastava](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20621048).   Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2029).
