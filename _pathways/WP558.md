description: 'Blood coagulation is a series of coordinated and calcium-dependent proenzyme-to-serine
  protease conversions likely to be localized on the surfaces of activated cells in
  vivo. It culminates in the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the
  conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clot. The kallikrein-kinin
  system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release
  of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated
  in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood
  pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective
  effects of preconditioning. Complement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated
  by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation:
  the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these
  pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector
  molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are
  the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent
  cells, and the direct killing of pathogens. Source: KEGG   Proteins on this pathway
