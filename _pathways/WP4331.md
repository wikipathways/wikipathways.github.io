description: Neovascularization (aka new vessel formation) is a crucial process related
  to wound healing. It supplies oxygen and nutrients to, and carries waste from, damaged
  tissue. Angiogenesis is a type of neovascularization, being a vital process in growth,
  development, and wound healing.
