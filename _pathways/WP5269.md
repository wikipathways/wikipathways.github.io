description: 'Porto sinusoidal vascular disease (PSVD), or formerly known as idiopathic
  portal vein hypertension (INCPH), is a condition with often unclear origin. There
  are currently three genes directly linked to this condition: C4orf54, a protein
  with unknown function, DGUOK, a desoxyguanosine kinase involved in purine metabolism,
  and KCNN3, a potassium channel regulated i.a. via estradiol.  Additionally, some
  genetic syndromes show increased portal vein hypertension as one of their symptoms/phenotypes.
  These syndromes are X-linked agammaglobulinemia, Adams-Oliver syndrome, chronic
  granulomatous disease and Shwachmann syndrome. X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA)
  is caused by mutations in BTK. BTK is involved in signal transduction from virus
  single stranded RNA recognition by toll like receptors (TLR8 and TLR9) to NFKB1
  mediated gene expression as response.  Adams-Oliver Syndrome can be caused by mutations
  in RBPJ, ARHGAP31, DOCK6, DLL4, EOGT and NOTCH1. Most of these genes are involved
  in the Notch pathway but there is also a link via RAC1 to the phagocyte NADPH oxidase
  complex (ComplexPortal).  Mutations in some proteins of this complex (CYBA, NCF1,
  NCF2 or NCF4), or their chaperones (CYBC1) can cause chronic granulomatous disease.  Shwachmann
  syndrome is caused by mutations in SBDS or EFL1 which are both part of the pre-60S
  ribosomal subunit and are responsible for cleaving off the EIF6 protein for maturation
  to 60S ribosomal subunit. '
