description: Functions of GIP and GLP-1, two agonists of which are found in the weight-loss
  drug tirzepatide (a.k.a. Mounjaro).  "Pancreatic and exopancreatic function of glucose‐dependent
  insulinotropic polypepide (GIP) and glucagon‐like peptide (GLP)‐1. GIP acts directly
  on the endocrine pancreas, bone, fat, gastrointestinal (GI) tract and brain. GLP‐1
  acts directly on the endocrine pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, heart and brain."  From
  Figure 2 in https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4020673/.
