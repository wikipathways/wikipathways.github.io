description: 'The adult hippocampus generates new neurons in the dentate gyrus of
  the hippocampus.  Type 1 neural stem cells (NSCs) undergo asymmetric division to
  generate type 2 progenitor cells (subtypes 2a and 2b), which further differentiate
  into type 3 cells or neuroblasts.  These neuroblasts then mature into immature neurons,
  eventually developing into fully mature granule cells.  The lower panel shows the
  timeframes during which Wnt ligands, Frizzled (FZD) receptors, co-receptors, downstream
  Wnt signaling pathways, and Wnt target genes are active (refer to main text for
  specifics). Abbreviations: DG: dentate gyrus, ML: molecular layer, GCL: granule
  cell layer, SGZ: subgranular zone.  Inspired by Figure 1 in [Arredondo](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7525004/).'
