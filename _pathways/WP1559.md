  title: A multivariable miRNA signature delineates the systemic hemodynamic impact
    of arteriovenous shunt placement in a pilot study (2020)
description: Transcription Factors that possibly regulate the expression of microRNAs
  related to cardiac hypertrophy. Interactions found by using TransMir. MicroRNAs
  are represented by a purple color and a rounded rectangle. Proteins on this pathway
  have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1559
  CPTAC Assay Portal].
