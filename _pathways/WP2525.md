description: This pathway shows the (one) carbon metabolism over grey and related
  pathways around it.  The one carbon donor pathway (WP2190) has been added to this
  one (additional conversions are coloured green for clarity of the origin); as well
  as WP3940 (overlapping content in bold), which was based on [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+mmu00270
  KEGG] and inferred from Mus musculus pathway [http://wikipathways.org/instance/WP1770_r96326
  WP1770_96326] with a 100.0% conversion rate.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2525
  CPTAC Assay Portal].
