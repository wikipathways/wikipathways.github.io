description: This pathway shows the (one) carbon metabolism over grey and related
  pathways around it.  The one carbon donor pathway (WP2190) has been added to this
  one (additional conversions are coloured green for clarity of the origin); as well
  as WP3940 (overlapping content in bold), which was based on [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+mmu00270)
  and inferred from Mus musculus pathway [WP1770_96326](http://wikipathways.org/instance/WP1770_r96326)
  with a 100.0% conversion rate.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available
  via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2525).
