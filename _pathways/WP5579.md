description: A recent study by the Dutch RIVM found that across The Netherlands seven
  PFAS are found in every tested human, with an additional nine found in at least
  10% of the population. Three of these PFAS were found to be associated to cancer.  PFOS,
  PFHxS, and PFOA were found to be significantly positively associated with testicular
  germ cell tumors (TGCT) among U.S. Air Force servicemen [PMID:37458713 ]. Data from
  a 2-year bioassay study on rats did not support a PFOS-related effect on testicular
  tumors, while serum PFOS concentrations were much higher in magnitude compared to
  levels reported in the former study [PMID:37751326]. This last study focussed on
  Leydig cell tumors (LCTs), which were described to not be comparable to TGCT [PMID:38099920].
  Furthermore, the animal model used in that study (Sprague-Dawley rats) for assessing
  environmental risk factors of human LCTs is questionable due to mechanistic differences
  in carcinogenesis as well as  incidence rate of spontaneous LCTs [PMID:38099920].
  This literary discussion concluded with another article, suggesting that the data
  collected on rats was not directly translational to humans, but should be included
  to obtain a full view of the potential effects of PFAS compounds [PMID:38099921].
