description: 'Several growth factors and hormones interact with particular beta-cell
  receptors to start intracellular signaling pathways that encourage cell division
  and growth. Hormones including prolactin (PRL), thyroid hormone (TH), growth hormone
  (GH), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and
  others have been closely linked. The modulation of B-cell proliferation has been
  linked to growth factors such as IGF-1, members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)
  family, nerve growth factor (NGF), members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-superfamily,
  placental growth factor (PLGF), and their corresponding receptors. This pathway
  provides information on how these various factors are realized. The figure is based
  on Jiang et al. (2018, doi: 10.3892/etm.2018.6603).'
