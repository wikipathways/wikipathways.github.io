description: 'The cell cycle is the series of events that takes place in a cell leading
  to its division and duplication (replication). Regulation of the cell cycle involves
  processes crucial to the survival of a cell, including the detection and repair
  of genetic damage as well as the prevention of uncontrolled cell division. Two key
  classes of regulatory molecules, cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), determine
  a cell''s progress through the cell cycle.  Sources: [Cell cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle),
  [KEGG](http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa04110.html). Protein phosphorylation
  sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP179).'
