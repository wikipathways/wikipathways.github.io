description: 'Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are the monomeric building
  blocks of DNA. In all cellular organisms, synthesis of the four canonical dNTPs
  (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP) required for DNA replication and repair involves the action
  of ribonucleotide reductase, which converts ribonucleotides to their corresponding
  deoxy- forms by substituting their 2-hydroxyl group with a hydrogen atom. S. cerevisiae
  contains a class Ia RNR that is composed of two large and two small subunits. RNR2
  and RNR4 encode the small subunits, while the large subunits are encoded by either
  RNR1 (major isoform) or RNR3 (minor isoform). Budding yeast RNR accepts ribonucleoside
  diphosphates (e.g. ADP, UDP) as substrate and converts them to their corresponding
  deoxy- forms (e.g. dADP, dUDP). These dNDPs can then be phosphorylated by NDP kinase
  (Ynk1p) to yield dNTPs. In contrast to the class I RNRs in yeast and other eukaryotes,
  class II and class III RNRs found in archaea and many bacteria can produce dNTPs
  directly by using NTPs as substrates.  Source: [yeastgenome](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/)'
