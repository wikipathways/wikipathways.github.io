description: 'Schematic of the most relevant molecular pathways and targeted agents
  in tripe negative breast cancer (TNBC). Tyrosine kinase receptor is activated upon
  binding of growth factors leading to activation of signaling pathways. PI3K/AKT
  pathway and inhibitor drugs: Phosphorylated PI3K activate AKT. The activation of
  AKT triggers downstream protein complexes mTORC activation that initiate gene transcription
  and promote cell growth. AR pathway is activated in LAR subtype tumors. Platinum
  drugs act through DNA damaging mechanism. PARP inhibitors induce “synthetic lethality”
  in BRCA deficient tumors. Pathway is based on figure figure in [Vagia et al](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32276534).'
