description: 'The urea cycle (also known as the ornithine cycle) is a cycle of biochemical
  reactions that produces urea ((NH2)2CO) from ammonia (NH3). This cycle occurs in
  ureotelic organisms. The urea cycle converts highly toxic ammonia to urea for excretion.
  This cycle was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered (Hans Krebs and Kurt Henseleit,
  1932), five years before the discovery of the TCA cycle. The urea cycle takes place
  primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys.  Amino acid catabolism
  results in waste ammonia. All animals need a way to excrete this product. Most aquatic
  organisms, or ammonotelic organisms, excrete ammonia without converting it. Ammonia
  is toxic, but upon excretion from aquatic species, it is diluted by the water outside
  the organism. Organisms that cannot easily and safely remove nitrogen as ammonia
  convert it to a less toxic substance such as urea or uric acid. The urea cycle mainly
  occurs in the liver. The urea produced by the liver is then released into the bloodstream
  where it travels to the kidneys and is ultimately excreted in urine. In species
  including birds and most insects, the ammonia is converted into uric acid or its
  urate salt, which is excreted in solid form. Source description: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle)  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP497).'
