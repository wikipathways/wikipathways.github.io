description: Development of pulmonary DC and macrophage subsets. This model of pulmonary
  DC and macrophage subset differentiation in mice summarizes recent findings suggesting
  early lineage commitment of cDCs in the BM and differentiation of monocytes into
  different population with DC, macrophage, or suppressive functions. All DC subsets
  present in the lung originate from hematopoietic progenitors (HSC) that differentiate
  into a common myeloid progenitor (CMP). Such CMPs further differentiate to a common
  DC progenitors (CDPs) or macrophage DC progenitors (MDPs). MDPs give rise to a common
  monocyte precursor (cMoP). In a CSF-1-dependent mechanism, Ly6Chi monocytes develop,
  which can further differentiate into Ly6Clo monocytes. Such Ly6Clo monocytes may
  also derive directly from cMoPs. Both monocyte populations can enter the lung and
  become monocyte-derived DCs, macrophages, or suppressor cells (25, 62). CDPs also
  serve as precursors for pDCs and pre-cDCs. Recent studies suggest that the two cDC
  populations deriving from the pre-cDC progenitor, i.e., CD103+ cDCs and CD11b+ cDCs,
  arise already in the bone marrow as pre-cDC1/cDC2 subtypes. One study suggested
  that pulmonary monocytes may differentiate into pulmonary CD103+ and CD11b+ DC;
  however, it is unclear whether such cells are phenotypically and functionally identical
  to CD103+ and CD11b+ cDCs. Activation of defined transcription factors (in blue)
  at distinct time points is critical for lineage commitment of the different DC precursors.
  During the early developmental stages, important transcription factors include STAT3,
  IRF8, and PU.1. At later stages, E2-2 is decisive for pDC commitment of CDPs. BATF3
  and IRF8 are associated with the CD103+ cDC and IRF4 with the CD11b+ differentiation.
  In addition to the transcription factors, several growth factors (in green) play
  key functions in the development of pre-cDCs and the different DC subsets, in particular
  Flt3L, CSF-1 (M-CSF), and CSF-2 (GM-CSF). The lung contains two major macrophage
  populations, i.e., alveolar and interstitial macrophages (AMs and IMs, respectively).
  It is now well appreciated that AMs derive from yolk sac and fetal liver progenitors
  that colonize the embryonic lung and are maintained by self-renewal at steady state.
  The origin of IMs remains elusive. Some data suggest that they represent monocyte-derived
  macrophages.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC
  Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3892)
