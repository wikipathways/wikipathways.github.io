description: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) enhances purine-rich PU-box-binding protein 1
  (PU.1)-dependent miR-146a transcription to suppress nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-driven
  monocyte and macrophage activation and thereby inflammation and atherosclerosis.  Environmental
  ligands of toll-like receptors (TLRs), including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and oxidized
  low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), caused by hyperlipidemia provoke inflammatory signaling
  in monocytes and macrophages resulting in NF-κB activation. Gene transcription from
  NF-κB activity results in the production of inflammatory mediators, including proatherogenic
  cytokines. It also results in the production of primary miR-146a (pri-miR-146a)
  that is subsequently processed into mature miR-146a that silences the expression
  of key TLR-adaptor molecules interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1)
  and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). The production of miR-146a thereby
  serves as a regulatory feedback loop to suppress NF-κB activity and resolve inflammation.
  Findings from our study identified that cellular apoE expression contributes to
  amplify this regulatory feedback loop by increasing PU.1-dependent transcription
  of pri-miR-146a and thereby mature miR-146a production.  Proteins on this pathway
  have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3926).
