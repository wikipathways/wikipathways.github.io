description: (A) FB-derived exosomes enriched with miR-21-3p or Spp1 and EGFR proteins
  are transferred to CMs, leading to CM hypertrophy. (B) EVs secreted from CMs or
  MSCs, as well as circulating EVs exert regulatory effects on CM apoptosis. (C) CM-derived
  exosomal HSP90 together with secreted IL-6 are able to activate STAT-3 signaling
  in cardiac FBs, leading to cardiac fibrosis; whereas CM-derived exosomes from exercised
  diabetic mice express high levels of miR-29b and miR-455, thus reducing cardiac
  fibrosis. (D) EVs secreted from CMs or MSCs are transferred to ECs, exerting pro-
  or anti-angiogenic activities.  Description from Bei et al.
