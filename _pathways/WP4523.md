description: 'In the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, cholesterol is transformed
  into mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids and sex hormones via a series of hydroxylation,
  oxidation and reduction steps. To better understand the molecular level of sexual
  organ maturation in humans, the classical pathway and the alternative pathway of
  this process are produced. The pathways produce the main steroid hormones in humans,
  namely progestogen, corticosteroids, androgens and estrogens.  The classical pathway
  produces androgen, a synthetic steroid hormone that regulates sexual development
  and maintenance of male sex organs by binding to androgen receptors. Next to the
  classical pathway of androgen synthesis, alternative pathways are known, such as
  [WP4524](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4524).  For more information
  and details about androgens and the diseases linked with this molecular pathway,
  see Chapter 37 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).  This pathway
  also includes information on glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid metabolism (previously
  captured in WP273; overlapping content is indicated with double borders for individual
  nodes; information previously missing is added with dashed borders).  Mineralocorticoid
  (M) and glucocorticoid (G) receptors regulate transcription; either through 11-beta-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase influencing aldosterone specificity on epithelial M-receptors or by
  modulation of AP-1- and NF-kappa-B-induced transcription through G-receptors. Specifically
  for the first case, aldosterone resistance in an autosomal form (a.k.a. pseudohypoaldosteronism)
  is linked to loss-of-function in epithelial Na-channel subunits [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.med.48.1.231](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.med.48.1.231). '
