description: IL-9 is a multifunctional cytokine, belonging to a family of cytokines.
  IL-9 was initially reported as a T cell growth factor in mice. It is now known to
  target multiple cell types. It plays an important role in the expansion and recruitment
  of mast cells in response to intestinal nematode infection or during autoimmune
  encephalomyelitis. It is also known to act on various cell types known to be involved
  in asthma including T cells, B cells, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and
  epithelial cells.
