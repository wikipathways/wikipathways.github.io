description: 'Ceramides and insulin resistance are connectedd. Ceramides are accumulated
  in tissues due to an excess of saturated fatty acids. In obese subjects, the amount
  of ceramides found in skeletal muscles is nearly double that of healthy subjects.   Ceramides
  are produced mostly by the sphingolipid pathway. Besides the sphingolipid pathway,
  ceramides are also produced by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin with the catalysis
  of nSMase2.   In the cell, ceramides play a role in insulin resistance. Ceramides
  inhibit the binding of PDX-1 and MAFA transcription factors to insulin promoter.
  Ceramides cause ER stress, which activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  MAPK8 and EIF2AK2. This leads to the upregulation of serine phosphorylation while
  downregulating tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. That, in turn, leads to the inhibition
  of recruitment and activation of PI3K. This leads to a downregulation in AKT1, an
  enzyme that stimulates the translocation of GLUT4. Ceramides also impair mitochondria
  functions and inhibit fatty acid oxidation, eventually leading to ROS and inflammation.
  Ceramides activate protein PP2A, which promotes the dephosphorylation of AKT1. PKCζ
  is also activated by ceramides to inhibit the activity of AKT1.   Moreover, palmitoyl-CoA
  downregulates the phosphorylation of AMPK, which leads to the increase of ER stress
  in the cell and decreases in fatty acid oxidation.   On the other hand, oleic acid
  inhibits the downregulation of AMPK caused by palmitoyl-CoA. Oleic acid also increases
  the expression of CPT1B, stimulating the fatty acid oxidation to reduce the inflammation
  in the cell.  '
