description: 'The Oxysterol group of compounds are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol
  or its sterol precursors, e.g. 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) or desmosterol. There
  are three mechanisms leading to the formation of oxysterols: 1) Enzymatically (first
  steps of sterol metabolism, being intermediates for the formation of steroid hormones,
  bile acids and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3); see https://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP4545,
  2) Non-enzymatically by encountering reactive oxygen species (ROS), providing a
  second pool of metabolites (this pool also includes oxidized cholesterol molecules
  taken in from diet); described in this pathway, and 3) Generation by the gut microflora
  and uptake through the enterohepatic circulation.   Previously oxysterols where
  though to be inactive metabolic intermediates, however recent findings have established
  that these metabolites are involved in cholesterol homoeostasis, can be ligands
  to nuclear and G protein-coupled receptors and biomarkers of diseases (for example
  Niemann-Pick disease).  This pathway describes Figure 4 and 5 from Griffiths et
  al. 2020 and was extended with disease information.'
