description: Amino acid metabolism in triple-negative breast cancer cells. The glutamine,
  serine and glycine metabolic pathways are significantly upregulated. The upregulated
  expression of key genes within the glutamine, serine and glycine metabolic pathways
  have also been observed in triple-negative breast cancer cells. Associated to the
  main shuttles described in figure 43.2 in the second edition of "Physician’s Guide
  to the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases" by Blau
  et al.
