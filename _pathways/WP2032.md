description: Human thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted
  from the anterior pituitary lobe, which plays an important physiological role in
  the regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis by stimulating production
  and secretion of the thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland and – on a longer time
  scale – growth and differentiation of thyrocytes. TSH binds to TSH receptor which
  is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily of integral membrane proteins.
  TSH exerts its action through various signaling cascades such as cAMP cascade and
  the phospholipase C beta-mediated inositol phosphate generation. Further, it will
  give signaling to NF-kappa B, mitogen activated protein kinases, protein kinase
  C modules.    [NetPath](http://www.netpath.org) is a collaborative project between
