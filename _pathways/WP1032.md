description: Mammalian cells have evolved a set of specialized pattern recognition-molecules
  (PRMs) to detect conserved molecular motifs present on pathogens known as pathogen
  associated-molecular-patterns (PAMPs). NLR proteins (alternatively named NBD-LRR
  or CATERPILLER) represent one subclass of PRMs that have recently attracted much
  attention. Their cytoplasmic location differs from the classical PRMs which are
  mostly membrane spanning receptors (such as the Toll-like-receptors (TLRs) or lectins)
  and accordingly NLRs were proposed to be activated mainly by intracellular bacterial
  pathogens.
