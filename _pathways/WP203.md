description: 'Purine nucleotides participate in many aspects of cellular metabolism
  including the structure of DNA and RNA, serving as enzyme cofactors, functioning
  in cellular signaling, acting as phosphate group donors, and generating cellular
  energy. Maintenance of the proper balance of intracellular pools of these nucleotides
  is critical to normal function. This occurs through a combination of de novo biosynthesis
  and salvage pathways for pre-existing purine bases, nucleosides and nucleotides.  The
  de novo biosynthetic pathway for purine nucleotides is highly conserved among organisms,
  but its regulation and the organization of the genes encoding the enzymes vary.
  This fourteen step pathway contains ten steps that branch at IMP to form AMP and
  GMP, each in two steps. Regulation of the pathway has been well studied in microbes
  such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but little
  is known about its regulation in higher eukaryotes (metazoa, and plants).  Source:
