description: 'While Saccharomyces cerevisiae can use most amino acids as their sole
  nitrogen source, they can only use a few amino acids as a carbon source to support
  growth (CITS:[Large86][Cooper82]).  This is in contrast to most eukaryotes and some
  fungi, which can metabolize amino acids completely, utilizing them as sole sources
  of carbon and nitrogen (CITS:[Stryer88][Large 86]). S. cerevisiae degrade the aromatic
  amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) and the branched-chain amino
  acids (valine, leucine, and iso-leucine) via the Ehrlich pathway (CITS:[Sentheshanmuganathan60][10989420]).  This
  pathway is comprised of the following steps:  1) deamination of the amino acid to
  the corresponding alpha-keto acid; 2) decarboxylation of the resulting alpha-keto
  acid to the respective aldehyde; and, 3) reduction of the aldehyde to form the corresponding
  long chain or complex alcohol, known as a fusel alcohol or fusel oil (CITS:[10989420][Large
  86]).  Fusel alcohols are important flavor and aroma compounds in yeast-fermented
  food products and beverages (as reported in (CITS:[9546164]).  The primary aminotransferase
  in tryptophan degradation is postulated to be Aro9p (CITS:[6763508]).  In vitro
  studies demonstrated that Aro9p is active with phenylpyruvate, pyruvate, or p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate,
  but not 2-oxoglutarate as the amino acceptor (CITS:[6763508]).  Aro9p is induced
  by aromatic amino acids and is subject to nitrogen regulation (CITS:[6763508][10207060]).
  The decarboxylase encoding gene ARO10 appears to be transcriptionally regulated
  in a similar fashion(CITS:[10207060]).  Gap1p, a general amino acid permease,  and
  Wap1p, an inducible amino acid permease with wide substrate specificity, appear
  to be the main uptake systems for utilizing aromatic amino acids (CITS:[10207060]).  SOURCE:
