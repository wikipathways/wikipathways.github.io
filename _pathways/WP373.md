description: 'Interleukin-3 belongs to a family of cytokines, which includes IL-5
  and GM-CSF. It signals through a receptor complex comprising of an IL-3 specific
  IL-3 receptor alpha subunit (IL3RA) and a common beta chain, which is shared between
  all members of this cytokine family. Binding of IL-3 to IL3RA recruits the beta
  chain to the complex, which activates the JAK/STAT, MAPK and PI 3-kinase signaling
  modules.  Source: NetPath http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_15'
