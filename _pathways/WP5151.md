description: 'This pathway describes the biosynthesis, activation and transfer of
  the sialic acid Neu5Ac to glycoproteins. Sialic acids are acidic sugar molecules
  that commonly occur as the terminal sugar as part of glycoproteins and glycolipids
  on the surface of cells. Sialylated conjugates play important roles in many processes,
  including cell recognition and signaling, neuronal development, cancer metastasis
  and bacterial or viral infection. The two most commonly mammalian sialic acids are
  N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc).  This pathway
  was modeled based on figure 1 from [https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31979120 Zhou
  et al]. '
