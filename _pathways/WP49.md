description: IL-2 is a multifunctional cytokine with pleiotropic effects on several
  cells of the immune system. IL-2 was originally discovered as a T cell growth factor,
  but it was also found to have actions related to B cell proliferation, and cytolytic
  activity of natural killer cells. IL-2 also activates lymphokine activated killer
  cells. In contrast to its proliferative effects, IL-2 also has potent activity in
  a process known as activation-induced cell death. More recently, IL-2 was shown
  to promote tolerance through its effects on regulatory T cell development. IL-2
  clinically has anti-cancer effects as well as utility in supporting T cell numbers
  in HIV/AIDS. There are three classes of IL-2 receptors, binding IL-2 with low, intermediate,
  or high-affinity. The low affinity receptor (IL-2RÃŽÂ± alone) is not functional;
  signaling by IL-2 involves either the high affinity hetero-trimeric receptor containing
  IL-2RÃŽÂ±, IL-2RÃŽÂ² and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (originally named
  IL-2RÃŽÂ³ and now generally denoted as ÃŽÂ³c) or the intermediate affinity heterodimeric
  receptor composed of IL-2RÃŽÂ² and ÃŽÂ³c. IL-2 stimulation induces the activation
  of the Janus family tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK3, which associate with IL-2RÃŽÂ²
  and ÃŽÂ³c, respectively. These kinases in turn phosphorylate IL-2RÃŽÂ² and induce
  tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription)
  and various other downstream targets. The downstream signaling pathways activated
  by IL-2 also involves mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  signaling modules, leading to both mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals. Please
