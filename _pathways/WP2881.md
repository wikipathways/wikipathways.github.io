description: The estrogen receptor is a nuclear receptor that is activated upon ligand
  binding and subsequently translocates to the nuclear. There, it activates transcription
  of target genes involved in  essential cellular processes. The ER receptor has been
  implicated in a multitude of diseases, most notably cancer (breast/ovarian).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2881
