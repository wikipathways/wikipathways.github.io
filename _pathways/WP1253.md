    hindlimbs in fetuin-A-deficient mice (2017)
description: Adapted from Raza et al. (2008). This pathway is initiated by IFNG binding
  to its receptor and a subsequent phosphorylation cascade involving a number of the
  JAK and STAT family of proteins. Several transcriptionally active complexes are
  formed (STAT1 homodimer, ISGF3 complex, STAT1:STAT1:IRF9 complex) and the pathway
  culminates with the transcriptional activation of target genes. [1]
