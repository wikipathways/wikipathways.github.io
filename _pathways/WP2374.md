  title: Signaling network of Oncostatin M pathway (2012)
description: 'Oncostatin M (OSM) is a member of the multifunctional cytokine interleukin
  6 (IL6) - type cytokine family. It is mainly produced in cell types such as activated
  T lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and in microglial cells. OSM
  signaling is initiated by the interaction of the cytokine to either: the type I
  LIFR-gp130 receptor complex, or to the type II OSMR-gp130 receptor [O’Hara et al].
  The major downstream signaling pathways that are activated in OSM signaling are
  JAK/STAT, Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K pathways [Halfter, Halfter, Stross, Brantley]. As
  the receptors lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, associated JAKs (JAK1, JAK2,
  JAK3 and TYK2) phosphorylate OSM receptor complex and STATs (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A,
  STAT5B, STAT6) [O’Hara, Fritz, Migita, Hintzen]. Phosphorylated STATs form homodimeric
  complexes (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5B) or heterodimeric complex (STAT1-STAT3) and translocate
  to the nucleus. Once inside nucleus STAT proteins bind to regulatory elements in
  the promoter of OSM-responsive genes and regulate the gene expression [O’Hara, Halfter,
  Halfter, Hintzen]. Alternatively, OSM induced phosphorylation of PTPN11, GRB2, SHC1,
  Ras/Raf molecules can bring about the activation of ERK1/2 signaling module [O’Hara].
  Oncostatin M -through ERK1/2 signaling module induces the phosphorylation of CEBPB,
  both CEBPB and EGR1 stimulates the transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism
  [Zhang]. Although OSM also causes induced phosphorylation in MAPK family members
  (MAPK8/9/14) the functional importance of this is at present not well understood
  [O’Hara, Li]. OSM mediated signaling cascade is negatively regulated by JAK1 inhibition
  by SOCS3 and STAT3 inhibition by PIAS3 [Stross, Brantley, Chung]. OSM also induced
  the activation of caspase family members (CASP3, CASP7, CASP9) through the JAK2
  module and regulates apoptosis [Auernhammer, Tiffen, Chipoy]. In osteosarcoma cells
  OSM is found to mediate apoptosis through a less understood STAT5B signaling module
  [Chipoy]. '
