description: 'Oncostatin M (OSM) is a member of the multifunctional cytokine interleukin
  6 (IL6) - type cytokine family. It is mainly produced in activated T lymphocytes,
  macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and microglial cells. OSM signaling is initiated
  by the interaction of the cytokine to either: the type I LIFR-gp130 receptor complex,
  or to the type II OSMR-gp130 receptor (O’Hara et al). The major downstream signaling
  pathways that are activated in OSM signaling are JAK/STAT, Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K
  pathways (Halfter, Halfter, Stross, Brantley). As the receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine
  kinase activity, associated JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) phosphorylate OSM receptor
  complex and STATs (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, STAT6) (O’Hara, Fritz, Migita,
  Hintzen). Phosphorylated STATs form homodimeric complexes (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5B)
  or heterodimeric complex (STAT1-STAT3) and translocate to the nucleus. Once inside
  nucleus STAT proteins bind to regulatory elements in the promoter of OSM-responsive
  genes and regulate the gene expression (O’Hara, Halfter, Halfter, Hintzen). Alternatively,
  OSM induced phosphorylation of PTPN11, GRB2, SHC1, Ras/Raf molecules can bring about
  the activation of ERK1/2 signaling module (O’Hara). Oncostatin M -through ERK1/2
  signaling module induces the phosphorylation of CEBPB, both CEBPB and EGR1 stimulates
  the transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism (Zhang). Although OSM also
  causes induced phosphorylation in MAPK family members (MAPK8/9/14) the functional
  importance of this is at present not well understood (O’Hara, Li). OSM mediated
  signaling cascade is negatively regulated by JAK1 inhibition by SOCS3 and STAT3
  inhibition by PIAS3 (Stross, Brantley, Chung). OSM also induces the activation of
  caspase family members (CASP3, CASP7, CASP9) through the JAK2 module and regulates
  apoptosis (Auernhammer, Tiffen, Chipoy). In osteosarcoma cells, OSM mediates apoptosis
  through a less understood STAT5B signaling module (Chipoy). '
