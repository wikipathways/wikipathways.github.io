description: 'The cytokine LIF and its downstream effector STAT3 are essential for
  maintenance of pluripotency in mouse ES cells. The requirement for the transcription
  factor Oct3/4 for ES cell pluripotency is also well-documented. However, LIF is
  not involved in self-renewal of human ES cells, suggesting that other pathways must
  play an important role in this process. The importance of other signal transduction
  pathways, including BMP and Wnt signalings, as well as novel transcription factors
  such as Nanog, is now being recognized.  Pathway source: Intracellular Signaling
