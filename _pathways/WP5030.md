description: Cysteine is converted into pyruvate and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) through
  desulphuration and deamination. Then, H2S is oxidised by SQR, after which ETHE1
  takes care of converting into sulfite (SO3 2-). One disorder named Ethylmalonic
  encephalopathy (EE) is linked to this pathway, a rare mitochondrial disease caused
  by variants within the ETHE1 gene.   This pathway was inspired by Chapter 9 (edition
  4) of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
