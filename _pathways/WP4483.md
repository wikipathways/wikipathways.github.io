description: Arachidonic acid metabolic pathway can be activated by inflammation (stimulus).
  Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by a phospholipase A2 (PLA-2)
  enzyme and converted to bioactive PGE-2 by COX-2. PGE2 induced transactivation of
  the EGFR by triggering Src and PGE2, an important regulator of CYP19A1 gene expression,
  stimulates CYP19A1 activity to increase localized estrogen 17-beta-estradiol (E2).
  The E2 binds to the classical ER to promote its dimerization and translocation to
  the nucleus where it modulates the expression of estrogen target genes (COX-2).
  The interaction of E2 with ER-alpha also activates signaling cascades that promote
  cell proliferation, such as the activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase (Src). Src activation
  stimulates a matrix metalloproteinase cascade that culminates in liberating the
  EGF. The free EGF ligand binds to EGFR family receptors that activates ERK signaling
  cascade. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA) is a substrate for ERK and phosphorylation
  of cPLA (cPLAp), promoting its association with intracellular membranes such as
  those of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria releasing lysophospholipids
  and arachidonic acid from these membranes. COX-2 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic
  acid into PGE-2. These key molecules and pathways that connect chronic inflammation
  with inflammation-associated oncogenic transformation could be targeted by drugs
  or natural products for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for malignant
  mesothelioma.
