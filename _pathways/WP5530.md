description: The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a series of cytoplasmic
  phosphorylation events triggered by the binding of mitogens, growth factors, and
  cytokines to their receptors.   *MAPK signaling effects on ARTD family members*  ERK
  signaling positively regulates both the expression and activity of PARP1.  When
  MEK, the kinase upstream of ERK in the MAPK cascade, was inhibited in conditioned
  medium-stimulated endothelial cells, it decreased PARP1 expression. On the other
  hand, overexpressing p-ERK2 in neurons led to an increase in PARP1 activity.   ERK
  signaling also influences Tankyrase 1 activity. In 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes
  stimulated by insulin, PDGF, and EGF, ERK phosphorylates Tankyrase 1.   JNK1 has
  been suggested as a positive regulator of PARP1 activation during H2O2-induced cell
  death in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In the context of multiple myeloma,
  JNK2 enhances PARP14 protein levels through an unknown mechanism.   *Positive regulation*  MAPK
  signaling is positively regulated by PARP1 and Tankyrase 1/2. Under normal conditions,
  phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) by MEK1/2 (MAPKK) induces conformational changes
  that activate ERK1/2, leading to the phosphorylation of downstream targets that
  promote cell growth, survival, and migration.   Perfusing rat hearts with a cytostatic
  agent increased cardiotoxicity and phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38. Inhibition
  of PARP1-dependent ADP-ribosylation with BGP-15 significantly reduces MAPK phosphorylation.   PARP1
  activation also correlates with JNK and p38 signaling in various cell types, especially
  in the context of ROS-dependent PARP1 activation and cell death, which depends on
  JNK and/or p38 signaling.   Although primarily observed in Drosophila melanogaster
  rather than mammalian cells, Tankyrase 1/2 have been implicated in JNK activation.   *Negative
  regulation*  In the case of Salmonella infection in human colonic epithelial cells,
  PARP inhibitor PJ-34 treatment increases ERK phosphorylation, NF-κB signaling, and
  IL-6 production/secretion, even at early time points.   Inhibition of PARP1 increased
  ERK activation and reduced cell death in H2O2-induced apoptosis of human WRL-68
  cells, while simultaneously lowering p-JNK and p-p38 levels. PARP14 interacts with
  and likely ADP-ribosylate JNK1, inhibiting its kinase activity and reducing JNK1-dependent
  apoptosis. Similarly, inhibition of PARP14 with PJ-34 leads to increased JNK1 activity
  and enhanced cell death.
