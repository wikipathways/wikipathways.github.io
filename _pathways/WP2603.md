description: Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris L.) belongs to the plant family
  Amaranthaceae and is a biennial plant responding to long days after a cold period.
  It is, however, cultivated as an annual crop, since the sucrose stored in the thickened
  taproot during the first vegetation period is used for bolting and flowering in
  the second growing season in response to vernalization thus reducing sugar yield.
  Much less is known on flowering time regulation in sugar beet than in the model
  plant Arabidopsis thaliana. One major gene involved in bolting/flowering time control
  in sugar beet is BTC1, controlling expression of the two beet FT homologs, of which
  one (BvFT1) has become a floral repressor, whereas the other (BvFT2) has retained
  its flowering-promoting function.
