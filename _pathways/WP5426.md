description: 'HDAC6 stands out as a distinctive member within the histone deacetylase
  family due to its predominant presence in the cytosol, facilitating its interaction
  with a wide array of non-histone proteins. Its dysregulation has been linked to
  various outcomes, encompassing diverse cancer types, immune-related disorders, and
  neurological conditions, including Alzheimer''s, Parkinson''s, ALS, Huntington''s,
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Rett syndrome. The current network represents the
  known HDAC6 interactions in the central nervous system (CNS). '
