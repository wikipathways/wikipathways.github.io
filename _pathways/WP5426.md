  title: A novel insight into neurological disorders through HDAC6 proteinâ€“protein
    interactions (2024)
communities:
- ONTOX
description: HDAC6 stands out as a distinctive member within the histone deacetylase
  family due to its predominant presence in the cytosol, facilitating its interaction
  with a wide array of non-histone proteins. Its dysregulation has been linked to
  various outcomes, encompassing diverse cancer types, immune-related disorders, and
  neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, Huntington's,
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Rett syndrome. The current network represents the
  known HDAC6 interactions in the central nervous system (CNS).
