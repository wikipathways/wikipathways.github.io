description: Interleukin 5 (IL-5) ligand belongs to the cytokine superfamily. IL-5
  is a glycoprotein which belongs to the cytokine superfamily. It possesses the four
  helical bundle motifs that is conserved among several hematopoietic cytokines. IL-5
  plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of eosinophils.
  IL-5 induces terminal maturation of eosinophils, prolongs eosinophils survival by
  delaying apoptotic death, increases eosinophils adhesion to endothelial cells and
  enhances eosinophils effector function. IL-5 plays important roles in the pathogenesis
  of asthma, hypereosinophilic syndromes and eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases.
  IL-5 is produced by eosinophils, mast cells, Th2 cells, Tc2 cells and gamma delta
  T cells. IL-5 exerts influence on different biological activities by associating
  with the IL-5 receptor.
