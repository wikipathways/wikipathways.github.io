description: 'In yeast, the sulfate assimilation pathway consists of sulfates uptake
  via Sul1p and Sul2p, activation to adenylate compounds, reduction to sulfide, and
  subsequent incorporation into carbon chains. The importance of activating sulfate
  to adenylyl sulfate (APS) and phosphoadenylyl sulfate (PAPS) stems from the fact
  that physiological reducing agents (e.g. NADPH, NADH) are not large enough in E0''
  to reduce sulfate directly. Adenylation lowers sulfate''s electropotential, enabling
  cells to circumvent what would otherwise be an endergonic reaction. After its conversion
  to PAPS, sulfate is reduced to sulfite by PAPS reductase (Met16p) and again to sulfide
  by sulfite reductase (Met5p and Met10p). The subsequent incorporation of sulfide
  into a carbon chain varies by organism; in S. cerevisiae, sulfide can react with
  O-acetylhomoserine via Met17p to form homocysteine, the major intermediate in the
  biosynthesis and interconversion of methionine and cysteine.  Source: [yeastgenome.org](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/)'
