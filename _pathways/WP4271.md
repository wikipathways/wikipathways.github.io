description: This pathway depicts the metabolism of cobalamin (also known as cbl or
  vitamin B12) and related diseases (for a full overview of the B12 metabolism, see
  [WP1533](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP1533)). Vit. B12 is derived
  from food sources and thereafter metabolised for 2 reasons; 1. to methylate homocysteine
  to methionine, and 2. to convert methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This pathway
  depicts 15 distinct diseases which are related to a malfunctioning in the absorption
  and transport section, or the intracellular processing of Cbl. However, the exact
  function of some proteins which have been linked to these diseases, remains unclear.
  Substitution of Vit. B12 is a therapeutic option for patients with  absorption and
  transport related diseases, however does not perform so well for patient with intracellular
  processing defects.  This pathway was inspired by Chapter 13 of the book of Blau
  (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
