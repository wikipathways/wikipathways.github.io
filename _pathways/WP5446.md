description: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a short protein that suppresses feeding
  and helps manage glucose levels in diabetes.  It is encoded by the GCG gene.  This
  pathway depicts factors in GLP-1 secretion from L cells in the intestine into the
  portal vein, the primary entry port of digestion products into circulation.  This
  diagram is based on Figure 2 of https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9190119/.
