description: 'Adapted from: Genetic mouse models for the functional analysis of the
  perifibrillar components collagen IX, COMP and matrilin-3: Implications for growth
  cartilage differentiation and endochondral ossification by [Frank Zaucke and Susanne
  Grässel](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19554514).  Model for supramolecular
  assembly of cartilage fibrils and filaments into fibrillar networks: Matrilin-3
  and COMP act as adaptor molecules to interconnect D-periodically banded fibrils
  with each other and/or with collagen VI beaded filaments to generate a heterotypic
  fibrillar network. The interaction may be mediated either by matrilin-1 / -3 binding
  directly to collagen IX or via COMP, which associates with the NC domains of collagen
  IX.  Linked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by
  mutation in the respective gene. '
