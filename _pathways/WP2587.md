description: '"The mechanisms regulating the vertebrate limb mesenchyme of chickens,
  have been extensively discussed in literature. There are currently two models. The
  first regards that progressive distalization of limb pattern is based on an autonomous
  clocklike mechanism, inherent to the undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. The second
  belives that instructive cues from surrounding tissues are responsible for specifying
  the PD segments (adapted from Cooper et al. 2011 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21617075])."  This
  pathway visualises the different steps in limb development, with corresponding literature.'
