  title: Extensive alternative splicing triggered by mitonuclear mismatch in naturally
    introgressed Rhinolophus bats (2021)
description: Complex III or quinol-cytochrome c reductase performs electron transfer
  coupled to proton pumping. It occurs as a symmetrical, tightly bound dimer (referred
  to as cIII2). This dimerisation occurs prior to the pre CIII complex formation,
  annotated as pre-CIII(2). Each monomer is composed of a catalytic core containing
  MT-CYB, CYC1 and UQCRFS1. An additional seven subunits are required for stability
  and/or correct assembly of the enzyme, but are not involved in the catalysis, but
