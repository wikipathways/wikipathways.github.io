description: 'Collaborative project for curation biological processes involved in
  the COVID-19 disease after SARS-Cov-2 infection. It focuses on experimental evidence
  and plays with improved annotation of complexes and with the Evidence and Conclusion
  Ontology. The complexes link to EBI''s Complex Portal, resulting from a collaboration
  with that database at the recent online ELIXIR biohackathon. Editing this pathway
  is (at this moment) coordinated via the wikipathways.slack.com #sarscov2 channel.
  Additionally, please feel free to add suggestions to the discussion page (see the
  tab at the top of this page). The large viral Spike protein (S or surface glycoprotein)
  forms trimers. It interacts with the host''s ACE2 receptor to establish binding
  (Hoffmann et al 2020). There are suggestions for more than one cell entry mechanism,
  with the evidence for ACE2/TMPRSS2 entry being most clear now. Lack of expression
  of TMPRSS2 may explain age differences in COVID19 severity. In this mechanism, to
  enter the virus needs to be primed by the host protease TMPRSS2 that splits the
  Spike protein into 2 peptides S1 and S2. S1 contains the ACE2 receptor binding site,
  S2 binds to the host cell membrane which leads to membrane fusion, the start of
  the uptake process. The ACE2 receptor interaction was also suggested as the start
  of specific lung-damaging effects. Other human genes that may be involved in alternative
  cell uptake mechanisms include CTSL and SLC6A19.'
