description: This pathway describes the mevalonate arm of the cholesterol biosynthesis
  pathway within different cellular regions. This pathway is also known as the isoprenoid
  pathway or HMG-CoA reductase pathway, and is an essential metabolic pathway present
  in eukaryotes, archaea, and some bacteria. This pathway produces two five-carbon
  building blocks (isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate
  (DMAPP)), which are the precursors for various isoprenoids, a compound class containing
  cholesterol, vitamin K, coenzyme Q10, and all steroid hormones.  View more details
  on which drugs are related to these reactions at [WP4189](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4189).
