description: Oxidative phosphorylation is the process in which ATP is formed as a
  result of the transfer of electrons from NADH or FADH2 to O2 by a series of electron
  carriers. This process, which takes place in mitochondria, is the major source of
  ATP in aerobic organisms. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21208/).
