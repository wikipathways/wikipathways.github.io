description: 'Melanoma, or malignant melanoma, is a highly aggressive cancer that
  develops in melanocytes. Many genes have been found to be mutated or amplified in
  melanoma, with the most commonly mutated genes being BRAF, CDKN2A, NRAS and TP53.
  MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling are central to melanoma.   This pathway is a summary
  of information from figures 1 and 2 from [Kunz and Vera](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6520749/)
  and supplemented with information from [KEGG](https://www.kegg.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa05218).   CDKN2A
  is frequently mutated in melanoma and germline mutations are associated with an
  increased susceptibility of developing skin cancer. The CDKN2A encodes two proteins,
  p16 (INK4A) and p14ARF, with different functions. p16 binds to CDK4, which prevents
  phosphorylation of Rb, thereby controlling the G1 to S transition. Without functioning
  p16, G1 to S transition can proceed. p14ARF is central to cell cycle regulation,
  inhibiting MDM2, which normally degrades p53, so loss of p14ARF has a similar effect
  to loss of p53. '
