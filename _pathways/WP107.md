description: Protein synthesis is the ultimate step of gene expression and a key control
  point for regulation. In particular, it enables cells to rapidly manipulate protein
  production without new mRNA synthesis, processing, or export. This pathway gives
  an overview of the translation factors involved in this process.  Proteins on this
  pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP107).
