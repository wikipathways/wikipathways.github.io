description: Following cellular activation or drug treatment, NFAT and NF-kB translocate
  to the nucleus and bind sites at the HIV-1 LTR. NFAT and NF-kB recruit p300/CBP
  to the LTR, resulting in acetylation of histone tails and transcriptional activation.
  In the case of NF-kB, proteosomal degradation of IkBa permits NF-kB translocation
  and displacement of the p50 homodimers. This is followed by Tat- dependent elongation
  in which Tat recruits the P-TEFb complex to TAR. Cdk9 phosphorylates the CTD of
  RNA Pol II, resulting in increased processivity. P-TEFb phosphorylates DSIF and
  NELF, resulting in removal of NELF from Pol II and converting DSIF into a positive
  elongation factor, thereby promoting productive elongation.  Data nodes in blue
  represent HIV proteins.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available
  via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3414).
