description: 'Inactivation of VHL due to mutation or DNA methylation is an early event
  in ccRCC that leads to accumulation of the transcription factor HIF-α, which dimerizes
  with HIF-β and translocates to the nucleus. The resulting HIF-α–HIF-β-induced up-regulation
  of downstream genes promotes cell proliferation, glucose uptake, glycolysis, and
  angiogenesis.   Mutations in chromatin remodelers and histone modifiers including
  PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1 and KDM5C lead to global abnormal gene expression patterns, and
  deficiency in DNA repair, which contributes to genomic instability.   Activation
  of PI3K–mTOR signaling promotes cell proliferation and tumor aggression, and increases
  translation of HIF-α, leading to enhanced HIF-α-mediated gene expression. The proposed
  development pattern of ccRCC is based on tumor evolution analyses and current understanding
  of genomic variation.  Description adapted from "Precision medicine from the renal
  cancer genome", Riazalhosseini and Lathrop.  Additional sources of information:
  mTORC1 complex is based on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanistic_target_of_rapamycin#mTORC1).
  PDGFB and TGFB as targets of HIF1A based on [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05211).  Phosphorylation
