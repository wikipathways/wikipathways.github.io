description: IL-11 is a multifunctional cytokine that belongs to the gp130 family.
  It was first isolated from a primate bone marrow derived cell line, PU-34 for its
  ability to stimulate the proliferation of a plasmacytoma cell line, T1165 which
  was dependent on IL-6. This cytokine plays an important role in the synthesis, maturation
  and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. It  also plays significant role in the
  inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, regulation of trophoblasts invasion and
  placentation in humans.   The receptor for IL-11 is IL11RA that uses the common
  gp130 receptor subunit for signal transduction. The pathways that are activated
  upon IL-11 stimulation are JAK-STAT, Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B/p65. Binding
  of IL-11 with IL-11RA results in the heterodimerization, tyrosine phosphorylation
  and activation of gp130. The activated IL11RA-gp130 receptor complex further activates
  Jak family of tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK2. Phosphorylated JAK2 then activates
  STAT3 and STAT1 that results in their subsequent translocation into the nucleus.
  The translocated STAT3 then induces the transcription of genes associated with endometrial
  cell adhesion, gastric inflammation and differentiation of periodontal ligament
  cells. The activation of STAT3 was shown to be inhibited by the overexpression of
  Suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3). IL-11 signalling through JAK2/STAT3
  has been shown to be crucial for normal placentation in humans and normal development
  of craniofacial bones and teeth in mice.  In addition to JAK-STAT, IL-11 also activate
  the Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B pathways. In response to IL-11, GTP loaded
  Ras interacts with RAF1 and leads to autophosphorylation of RAF1. Activation of
  RAF1 leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of mitogen activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs) through MEK1 and MEK2. Activation of phospholipase D was triggered
  by IL-11 leading to the formation of phosphatidic acid, which has also been shown
  to activate the MAPKs. Transcription factors, ATF1 and CREB1 were activated by these
  phosphorylated MAPKs through p90 S6 kinase. PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B/p65 pathways
  stimulated by IL-11 have been shown to enhance the migration and proliferation of
  chondrosarcoma cells. In CD4+ T cells, Th2 polarization was induced by IL-11 through
  NF-kappa B inhibition. SRC, FYN and YES, members of Src family of tyrosine kinases
  were also activated in response to IL-11 signalling.  Please access this pathway
