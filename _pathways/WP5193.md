description: Cholesterol is synthesized via a cascade of enzymatic reactions known
  as the mevalonate pathway. This series of reactions is primarily regulated by a
  rate-limiting step involving the conversion of hydroxyl-methyl glutaryl-coenzyme
  A (HMG-CoA) into mevalonate. In this pathway multiple diseases and disorders involving
  the cholesterol synthesis are included and its role depicted in the pathway.
