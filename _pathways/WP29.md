  title: Effect of VCP modulators on gene expression profiles of retinal ganglion
    cells in an acute injury mouse model (2020)
description: The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular
  signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms
  in the Animal kingdom. The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass
  receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged/Serrate families
  of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved,
  but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional
  proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the
  plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex
  with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc)-co-repressor
  (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone
  acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the
  transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.
