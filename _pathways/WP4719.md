description: This pathway is inspired by the [Lipidmaps>Eicosanoids Pathway expended
  pathway display](https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps) and extended with
  the top left side of Figure 1 from [Dennis and Norris 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26139350).
  Eicosanoids are a large group of compounds metabolised from arachidonic acid (AA),
  either via cyclooxygenases (COX) [WP4347](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4347),
  lipooxygenases(LOX) [WP4348](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4348),
  or cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP) [WP4349](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4349).
  This pathway visualizes the first route, via COX, where additonal colours have been
  used to visualise which conversions are being performed by the same enzymes. Green
  and orange boxes represent receptors, where the orange colour depicts peroxisome-proliferator
  activating receptors (PPARs) potentially activated by the eicosanoids.
