description: 'Primary or idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) a cause
  of nephrotic syndrome in children and adolescents, as well as an important cause
  of end stage renal disease in adults. FSGS is mainly associated with foot process
  effacement, proliferation of mesangial, endothelial and epithelial cells in the
  early stages followed by collapse of glomerular capillaries leading to scarring.
  It may lead to dramatic manifestations such as proteinuria, hypoaluminemia, and
  hypertension. Also, there are many inheritable genetic abnormalities that can cause
  podocyte damage of FSGS caused by mutations in proteins that are important for podocyte
  function. The genes include CD2AP, MYO1E, WNT1, and LAMB2. On the far left, the
  diagram illustrates molecular interactions between a normal podocyte and matrix
  interactions. ACTN4 and SYNPO and DAG1 interacting with AGRN associate with the
  actin cytoskeleton; these actin associated proteins might play a role in maintaining
  podocyte and GBM architecture. DAG1 binds to UTRN, which in turn binds an actin
  filament, thus completing the link between the actin-based cytoskeleton and the
  extracellular matrix. Podocyte foot processes are anchored to the glomerular basement
  membrane (GBM) via ITGB1 and ITGA3 integrin complex and DAG1-UTRN complex. Transmembrane
  proteins such as LAMA5 and CD151 bind to ITGB1 and ITGA3, respectively. The intracellular
  integrins combine with cytoskeletal via intermediates which include TLN1, VCL, and
  PAX complex and the ILK, PARVA, and LIMS1 complex. (Guanghua Hu et. al 2013 - Biomedicine
  and Aging Pathology vol 3) Upon primary podocyte injury, there are multiple pathways
  involved in podocyte injury. "Sustaining NPHS1 and phosphorylation might contribute
  to both anti-apoptotic signaling and actin polymerization. The CD80 pathway may
  be targeted by TLR4 or blocking the binding of B7-1 to slit diaphragm structure
  proteins such as KIRREL2/3. PLAUR could be inhibited by interfering with binding
  of PLAUR and ITGAV/B3 integrin, inhibiting ITGB3 integrin activation, or inhibiting
  binding of ITGAV/B3 integrin to VTN. The notch pathway can be targeted by interfering
  with its upstream activation by blocking the TGF-Î²1 effect, inhibiting Î³-secretase,
  which is required for proteolytic receptor activation, or interfering with target
  gene transcription." (Reiser J. et al 2010 - Kidney Int vol 77) Post podocyte development,
  increased activation of NOTCH1 and WNT/CTNNB1 activities contribute to glomerulosclerosis.
  Expression of JAG1 on the ligand-expressing cell induces proteolytic cleavage of
  the Notch receptor on the signal-receiving cell, releasing the NOTCH1. DKK1 inhibits
  WNT1 binding to LRP5/6. By inhibiting the destruction of CTNNB1, CTNNB1 is stablilized.
  "The CTSL pathway could be targeted by specifically inhibiting CTSL expression or
  activity, shifting the equilibrium of SYNPO toward the phosphorylated form by inhibiting
  calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation or enhancing PKA or CAMK2B-mediated phosphorylation,
  protecting SYNPO and DNM1 by compounds that bind to the CTSL cleavage site, or delivering
  cleavage-resistant SYNPO and DNM1 mutants." (Reiser J. et al 2010 - Kidney Int vol
  77) The destruction of podocyte''s cytoskeleton architecture leads to lose of normal
  podocyte epitopes such as VIM, SYNPO, and WT1, and lose of cyclin-dependent kinase
  inhibitors CDKN1C and CDKN1B. Also, podocytes acquire proliferation of CDKN1A. This
  leads to podocytopenia which have been shown to cause primary FSGS and then followed
  by end-stage renal disease (ESRD). FSGS is also induced by microRNA-193a and its
  downregulation of WT1, destroying podocyte foot processes. There is insufficient
  evidence that segmental glomerular lesions can be caused by other drugs or toxins,
  apart from some used experimentally such as doxorubicin and puromycin aminonucleoside.  Treatments
  such as steroids, high-dose cyclosporine, ritxuximab can reduce proteinuria based
  on their immunosuppressive properties and through stabilization of the podocyte
  actin cytoskeleton. '
