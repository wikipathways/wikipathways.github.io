description: 'The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) for thyroid hormone-mediated neurodevelopmental
  adversities describes how disruptions in thyroid hormone homeostasis lead to impaired
  neurodevelopment. It begins with molecular initiating events (MIEs) such as altered
  thyroid hormone transport, metabolism, or receptor signaling, affecting key players
  like MCT8 (SLCO1A2), OATP1C1 (SLCO1C1), and thyroid hormone receptors (TRα1). These
  disruptions impair cellular processes essential for neurodevelopment, including
  myelination, synaptogenesis, and neural network formation, particularly in astrocytes,
  neurons, and oligodendrocytes. As a result, key events (KEs) such as reduced thyroid
  hormone availability in the brain, altered neuronal differentiation, and impaired
  synaptic function occur, ultimately leading to adverse outcomes like cognitive deficits
  and neurodevelopmental disorders. '
