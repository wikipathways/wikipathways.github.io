description: Type I collagen — the major protein component of the extracellular matrix
  in bone, skin and tendon — is mainly secreted by osteoblasts, dermal fibroblasts
  and tenocytes. Despite the relatively simple structure of the collagen triple helix,
  the biosynthesis of type I procollagen is extremely complex, involving multiple
  steps and requiring an ensemble of proteins for post-translational modifications,
  folding, transport, secretion and quality control. The COL1A1 and COL1A2 transcripts
  are translated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), and the α(I)‑chains undergo
  a series of post-translational modifications. Helical prolines in position Y of
  the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat are hydroxylated in position C4 by prolyl 4‑hydroxylase 1
  (P4H1), whereas specific prolines in the X positions are 3‑hydroxylated by P3H1
  and P3H2. Some lysine residues are hydroxylated by lysyl hydroxylases (LH1 and LH2,
  encoded by PLOD1 and PLOD2 respectively), and glycosylation of hydroxylysines into
  galactosyl-hydroxylysine and glucosyl-galactosyl-hydroxylysine is catalysed by procollagen
  galactosyltransferase 1 and procollagen glucosyltransferase 1. After synthesis of
  the carboxy-terminal propeptide, it forms intra-chain disulfide bonds and remains
  attached to the rER membrane. Selection and association of the correct chains into
  a triple helix occur by diffusion of the C-propeptides attached to the rER membrane.
  A nucleus for triple helix formation is formed that staggers the chains in the correct
  order and initiates triple helix formation. Protein disulfide isomerase catalyses
  inter-chain disulfide bond formation, which stabilize the folding nucleus. Hydroxylation
  of proline residues and some lysine residues continues and triple helix formation
  proceeds from the C-terminal end towards the amino-terminal end. During this phase,
  65 kDa FK506‑binding protein (FKBP65; encoded by FKBP10) and a complex formed by
  P3H1 — CRTAP– PPIase B (peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase B) — seem to play a
  crucial part. The complex is involved in the Hydroxylation of proline 986 of the
  collagen α1(I)-chain and α1(II)-chain and proline 707 of the α2(I)-chain, which
  are thought to be important for supramolecular assembly of collagen fibrils and
  to serve as binding sites for chaperones or small leucine-rich proteoglycans. Beyond
  its prolyl 3‑hydroxylase activity, the complex functions as a PPIase and chaperone
  for collagen folding. Indeed, the fast propagation of the triple helix requires
  the isomerization of cis peptide bonds that convert proline residues into trans
  configuration, mainly by PPIase B24. When most of the helix is folded, the N-propeptides
  associate and form the small triple helix within this domain. The newly formed triple
  helix is stabilized by serpin H1 (also known as HSP47; encoded by SERPINH1) and
  FKBP65. Further modifications occur during transport from the rER to the Golgi apparatus
  in special coat protein complex vesicles that contain melanoma inhibitory activity
  protein 3 (also known as TANGO1, encoded by MIA) and through the Golgi stack by
  cisternal maturation. Serpin H1 also has binding sites along the helical portion
  of the molecule and assists shuttling of folded collagen into the cis-Golgi. These
  biosynthetic steps depend on a proper rER environment (for example, optimal calcium
  levels and redox potential), and the quality-control mechanisms can lead to the
  activation of the unfolded protein response using the ER-associated degradation
  pathway or the autophagy-mediated lysosomal degradation system to eliminate molecules
  that were not properly folded. Once secreted, the propeptides of procollagen are
  cleaved by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 2 (ADAMTS2)
  and bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) into mature type I collagen. This initiates
  collagen fibre formation and these fibrils are stabilized by crosslink formation,
  in which certain lysine and hydroxylysine residues in the triple helix and the  telopeptides
  are oxidized by lysyl oxidases and converted into allysine and hydroxyallysine.
  These residues then initially form divalent crosslinks that convert into mature
  trivalent pyridinoline and pyrrole crosslinks to stabilize the fibril structure
  in tissues.  Bone formation consists of the secretion of bone extracellular matrix
  components (mainly type I collagen) by osteoblasts. The unmineralized bone matrix
  (osteoid) subsequently becomes mineralized. In addition, osteoblasts and osteocytes
  release many cytokines, including receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand
  (RANKL; also known as TNFSF11) and osteoprotegerin (OPG, encoded by TNFRSF11B),
  which regulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. RANKL acts on osteoclast precursor
  cells by binding to receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK; also known as
  TNFRSF11A) on their surface, thereby favouring their differentiation to osteoclasts.
  OPG, by interacting with RANKL, prevents the binding of RANKL to RANK. Some osteoblasts
  become embedded in the mineralized bone matrix and differentiate to osteocytes,
  which produce, among other factors, sclerostin, an inhibitor of the WNT pathway
  that is known to stimulate bone formation by stimulating osteoblast activity.  Linked
  with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in
  the respective gene.  Adapted from [5]
