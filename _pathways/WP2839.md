  title: Fish as Model Systems to Study Epigenetic Drivers in Human Self-Domestication
    and Neurodevelopmental Cognitive Disorders (2022)
description: 'The hair follicle (HF) is the biological unit responsible for producing
  a single hair shaft. The follicles are arranged with concentric epithelial progenitor
  layers surrounding the dermal core, which is the dermal papilla (DP). Classically,
  the development of the follicle itself can be divided into three stages: [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2804
  Induction], Organogenesis and [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2840
  Cytodifferentiation].  Hair follicle development is a process dependent on epithelial-mesenchymal
  transitions orchestrated by many signaling pathways. Here we find one of three complex
  regulatory pathways assembled from a text mining approach portraying the development
  of this key mammal-specific structure.'
