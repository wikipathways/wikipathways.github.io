description: 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is one of the most common inherited
  peripheral neuropathies. This peripheral neuropathy is highly heterogeneous (clinically
  and genetically) and is characterized by a slowly progressive degeneration of the
  muscle of the foot, lower leg, hand and forearm, accompanied by sensory loss in
  the toes, fingers and limbs. Mutations in genes involved in intracellular trafficking
  are increasingly being implicated in various human diseases, including neuronal
  diseases. This pathway highlights genes with known mutations in CMTs relevant to
  intracellular trafficking.   DNM2 regulates vesicle budding. KIF1B controls vesicle
  motility on microtubules. LITAF and LRSAM are present in the endocytic pathway and
  probably regulate protein degradation. Myotubularin-related proteins (MTMR2 and
  MTMR13) and FIG4 regulate PI metabolism at the level of early endosomes and late
  endosomes, respectively. Rab7 is present on late endosomes and regulates transport
  to lysosomes. SH3TC2 regulates endosomal recycling together with Rab11, while NDRG1
  regulates membrane traffic at the level of early endosomes together with Rab4 and
  PRA1. HSPs regulate proteasomal degradation and associate with neurofilaments and
  actin filaments. FGD4 associates with and regulates actin filaments. MFN2 and GDAP
  regulate mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial axonal transport.  This pathway
  is based on figure 4 and table 1 from [Bucci et al](http://europepmc.org/article/PMC/3514635).
