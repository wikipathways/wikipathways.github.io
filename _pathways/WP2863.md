description: This plant pathway represents the Krebs cycle (mitochondrion). Pyruvate
  is imported from the glycolysis ([WP2862](https://classic.wikipathways.org/instance/WP2862))
  and converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle by getting linked with
  oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid. The cycle produces ATP and NADH, releases
  CO2 and finally regenerated oxaloacetic acid.
