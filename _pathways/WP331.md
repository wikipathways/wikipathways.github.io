description: 'Threonine biosynthesis as shown here covers the process of converting
  L-Aspartate into threonine. This pathway is regulated at multiple points by its
  end product, both via enzyme inhibition and attenuation. There is a three-step pathway
  that converts L-aspartate into homoserine. Two of the three enzymes that catalyze
  the first step in this pathway are bifunctional, also serving to catalyze the later
  step in the pathway. Homoserine feeds into biosynthetic pathways for both threonine
  and methionine. Fittingly, this pathway is regulated by the outputs of both of those
  pathways. SOURCE: SGD pathways, http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/server.html'
