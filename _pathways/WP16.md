description: 'Sphingolipids are essential components of the plasma membrane in all
  eukaryotic cells.  S. cerevisiae cells make three complex sphingolipids: inositol-phosphoceramide
  (IPC), mannose-inositol-phosphoceramide (MIPC), and mannose-(inositol phosphate)2-ceramide
  (M(IP)2C)(CITS: [12069845]).  In the yeast plasma membrane sphingolipids concentrate
  with ergosterol to form lipid rafts, specialized membrane microdomains implicated
  in a variety of cellular processes, including sorting of membrane proteins and lipids,
  as well as organizing and regulating signaling cascades (CITS: [12452424]).  Intermediates
  in sphingolipid biosynthesis have been shown to play important roles as signaling
  molecules and growth regulators.  Sphingolipid long chain bases (LCBs), dihydrosphingosine
  (DHS) and phytosphingosine (PHS), have been implicated as secondary messengers in
  signaling pathways that regulate heat stress response (CITS: [9405471])(CITS: [11967828]).  Other
  intermediates, phytoceramide and long-chain base phosphates (LCBPs), have been shown
  to be components of the tightly-controlled ceramide/LCBP rheostat, which regulates
  cell growth (CITS: [12684378]).  Since phosphoinositol-containing sphingolipids
  are unique to fungi, the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway is considered a target
  for antifungal drugs (CITS: [9092515])(CITS: [15578972]).  SOURCE: SGD pathways,
