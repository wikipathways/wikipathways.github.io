  title: Understanding signaling and metabolic paths using semantified and harmonized
    information about biological interactions (2022)
description: Dietary tryptophane is metabolised by the gut microbiome to indole and
  IPA which reaches the human blood system. Indole is further metabolized into indoxyl
  sulfate which also reached the blood.
