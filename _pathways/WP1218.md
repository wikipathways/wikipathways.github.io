description: When glucose is unused, it is metabolized via the polyol pathway. This
  pathway consists of two main enzymatic steps. First, glucose is reduced to sorbitol
  by aldose reductase. In this step, NADPH is oxidized to NADP+. The next step is
  the oxidation of sorbitol to D-fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. Fructose can
  then be phosphorylated by fructokinase and subsequently be metabolized via dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate or glyceraldehyde to D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which can be used as
  a substrate in the process of glycolysis. The sorbitol pathway plays a role in diabetic
  renal complications because aldose reductase metabolizes the excess of glucose to
  toxic metabolites that induce hyperfiltration and glomerular dysfunction.
