description: 'This pathway was created using the [GPCRDB](http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/)
  (Horn et al., 1998), (originally at the [CMBI](http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/7tm/)). The
  groupings are based on the GPCR phylogenetic tree available from the GPCRDB and
  the training sets used by Karchin et al. (Bioinformatics, 2002, pg. 147-159). The
  labels indicate children and grandchildren of the various classes of GPCRs as described
