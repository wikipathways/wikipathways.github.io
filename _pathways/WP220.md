description: The deoxynucleotides required for DNA synthesis can either be made de
  novo, or they can be salvaged from endogenous degradation processes. If the required
  substrates are available, the salvage pathways of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides
  are preferred over de novo synthesis pathways for pyrimidine biosynthesis. As with
  many of the metabolic pathways of S. cerevisiae, the pathways for the salvage of
  pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides are regulated by a variety of processes, including
  transcription regulation.  Description adapted from [YeastPathways](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/)
