description: 'This Pathway is a schematic representation of Glycerol metabolism, which
  is an important intermediate metabolite, acting as a bridge between carbohydrate
  and lipid metabolism. This pathway also depicts inherited metabolic diseases that
  disrupt glycerol metabolism including: Glycerol kinase deficiency, Glycerate kinase
  deficiency, Aquaporin 7 deficiency and Cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  deficiency. This pathway was inspired by chapter 49 (Disorders of Glycerol Metabolism)
  of the book of Blau (ISBN 978-3-030-67726-8).'
