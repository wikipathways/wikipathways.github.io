description: 'Evolocumab (Repatha) is an injectable monoclonal antibody that reduces
  LDL cholesterol levels. A limited quantity of LDL cholesterol is extracted from
  circulative blood when PCSK9-bound LDLR is degraded upon internalization in liver
  cells. Evolocumab competitively binds PCSK9 away from LDLR complexes, which allows
  LDLR to be recycled, returning to the surface and clearing additional molecules
  of LDL cholesterol. '
