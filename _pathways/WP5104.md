description: Autoimmune diseases have been shown to cause an increased level of C3NeF,
  which makes the C3bBb comples more stable. Because of this, there will be continuous
  stimulation of the alternative pathway, leading to excess amounts of membrane attack
  complex. These MACs will lead to adipocyte lysis, causing Barraquer-Simons syndrome.  Many
  patients have shown mutations in the LMNB2 gene, but this is not the case for all
  patients. Some people with mutations in this gene do not have the disease. More
  evidence is therefore required to conclude if this gene is linked to the disease.  Patients
  with this disease have a decrease of fat in the face, neck, upper extremities, trunk
  and upper abdomen. Some patients also have excess fat over the gluteal region, thighs
  and calves.
