description: 'The CDP-choline pathway, first identified by Eugene Kennedy in 1956,
  is the predominant mechanism by which mammalian cells synthesize phosphatidylcholine
  (PC) for incorporation into membranes or lipid-derived signalling molecules. The
  CDP-choline pathway on the left-hand side represents one half of what is known as
  the Kennedy pathway. The other half on the right-hand side is the CDP-ethanolamine
  pathway which is responsible for the biosynthesis of the phospholipid product phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE). Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDP-choline_pathway).'
