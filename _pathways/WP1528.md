description: Pathways in physiological and pathological hypertrophy of the heart.
  Largely based on the article from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11714087
  Wang et al, 'Signal transduction in cardiac hypertrophy--dissecting compensatory
  versus pathological pathways utilizing a transgenic approach.] Hypertrohpy of the
  heart can be a physiological compensation for exercise, but it can also be a pathological
  compensation for hypertension and stress.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1528
