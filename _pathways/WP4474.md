description: This pathway is modeled based on fig 10 in [Hulsmans et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29339450),
  and was developed in collaboration with Dr. Matthias Nahrendorf.  Circulating monocytes
  and myocardial macrophage density are increased in diastolic dysfunction, and the
  macrophage expansion is partially driven by monocyte recruitment. Mechanistically,
  cardiac macrophages produce more IL-10 leading to autocrine activation toward a
  fibrogenic phenotype. A profibrotic macrophage subset secretes more Spp1 (OPN) and
  fewer proteases and MMPs, contributing to fibroblast activation, collagen deposition,
  and subsequently increased myocardial stiffness and diastolic dysfunction. (Description
  based on figure 10 legend).
