description: The blood protein fibrinogen, a key component of the coagulation cascade,
  has been identified as an early molecular factor triggering inflammation in the
  brain and periphery (see bibliography). Upon fibrinogen extravasation across leaky
  vessels (i.e., break down of the blood-brain barrier), fibrinogen is converted by
  thrombin to insoluble fibrin. Based on published studies, this signaling pathway
  highlights fibrin as a CD11b/CD18 (complement receptor; CR3) integrin receptor ligand
  that regulates innate immunity. Fibrin activates central nervous system (CNS) resident
  microglia and peripheral (bone marrow-derived) macrophages via CR3, leading to intracellular
  kinase signaling activation including PI3K, AKT1, and RhoA activity that regulates
  phagocytosis; and NF-κB translocation to the nucleus that transcriptionally regulates
  proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit T-cells and macrophages. Canonical
  LPS-TLR4 activation of innate immune cells and potential mechanisms of CD11b transactivation
  are shown.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC
  Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4136).
