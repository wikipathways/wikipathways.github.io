  title: A pathway approach to investigate the function and regulation of SREBPs (2013)
communities:
- MetaKids
- ONTOX
description: 'Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are membrane-bound
  proteins that act as transcription factors. They regulate lipid, especially cholesterol,
  biosynthesis and uptake at a transcriptional level to maintain cellular lipid homeostasis.
  In addition, SREBP appears to be involved in a variety of other cellular processes.
  This pathway of SREBP focuses on the regulation of lipid metabolism by SREBP. The
  data on which this pathway is based, is derived from a variety of in vitro and in
  vivo studies using different species, including mouse, rat, hamster and human.  This
  pathway served as the basis for a review about SREBP that was published in Genes
  and Nutrition: [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23516131).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1982).'
