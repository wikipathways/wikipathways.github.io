description: 'CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation
  of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two
  major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression.
  The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic
  changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation
  of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as  microsatellite instability
  (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2
  by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding
  microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX.

  tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair
  genes in HNPCC).  This pathway is based on information from [http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?map05210

  40 is almost 100%.  The impact of KRAS mutations is heavily dependent on the order
  of mutations. Primary KRAS mutations generally lead to a self-limiting hyperplastic

  to cancer. KRAS mutation is predictive of a very poor response to panitumumab and
  cetuximab therapy in colorectal cancer. Currently, the most reliable way to predict
  whether a colorectal cancer patient will respond to one of the EGFR-inhibiting drugs
  is to test for certain “activating” mutations in the gene that encodes KRAS, which
  occurs in 30%–50% of colorectal cancers. Studies show patients whose tumors express
  the mutated version of the KRAS gene will not respond to cetuximab or panitumumab.
