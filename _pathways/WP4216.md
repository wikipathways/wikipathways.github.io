description: 'CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation
  of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two
  major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression.
  The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic
  changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation
  of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as  microsatellite instability
  (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2
  by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding
  microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX.
  Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the
  tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair
  genes in HNPCC).  This pathway is based on information from [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?map05210).  The
  most common mutation in colon cancer is inactivation of APC. When APC does not have
  an inactivating mutation, frequently there are activating mutations in β-catenin.
  In order for cancer to develop, both alleles must be mutated. Mutations in APC or
  β-catenin must be followed by other mutations to become cancerous; however, in carriers
  of an APC inactivating mutations, the risk of colorectal cancer by age 40 is almost
  100%.  The impact of KRAS mutations is heavily dependent on the order of mutations.
  Primary KRAS mutations generally lead to a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline
  lesion, but if they occur after a previous APC mutation it often progresses to cancer.
  KRAS mutation is predictive of a very poor response to panitumumab and cetuximab
  therapy in colorectal cancer. Currently, the most reliable way to predict whether
  a colorectal cancer patient will respond to one of the EGFR-inhibiting drugs is
  to test for certain “activating” mutations in the gene that encodes KRAS, which
  occurs in 30%–50% of colorectal cancers. Studies show patients whose tumors express
  the mutated version of the KRAS gene will not respond to cetuximab or panitumumab.

  can be considered a conditional tumor suppressor gene as well as a conditional oncogene.
  When DCC is present and not activated by netrin it is proapoptotic, and represses
  tumor formation. When DCC is present and netrin-activated it promotes cell survival,
  acting as an oncoprotein. One of the most frequent genetic abnormalities that occur
  in advanced colorectal cancer is loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of DCC in region 18q21.
