description: Cytosolic DNA and RNA can lead to innate immune sensing via three paths.
  DNA is sensed by cGAS, which activates STING. RNA is sensed by MDA5 and RIG-I, which
  activates MAVS. An activation of STING or MAVS lead to phosphorylation of IFR3,
  which triggers innate immune responses.  This pathway was inspired by Chapter 14
  of the 5th edition of the book of Blau.
