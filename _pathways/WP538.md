description: 'Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine, and
  tryptophan proceeds via a common pathway to chorismate, at which point the pathway
  branches ([yeastgenome S000070200](https://www.yeastgenome.org/reference/S000070200),
  [pubmed:1943992](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992)). One branch proceeds
  to tyrosine and phenylalanine, and the other to tryptophan ([yeastgenome S000070200](https://www.yeastgenome.org/reference/S000070200)).
  The series of reactions to chorismate, called the shikimate pathway, and the series
  of reactions from chorismate to tryptophan have been found to be common to all eukaryotes
  and prokaryotes studied thus far ([pubmed:1943992](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992)).
  In contrast, there appears to be two separate routes for tyrosine and phenylalanine
  biosynthesis from chorismate, only one of which has been found in S. cerevisiae
  ([pubmed:1943992](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992)). S. cerevisiae, similar
  to E. coli, synthesize tyrosine and phenylalanine via the intermediate 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
  and phenylpyruvate, respectively, whereas some other organisms synthesize them via
  arogenate ([pubmed:1943992](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992)). Aromatic
  amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback
  inhibition, activation of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis ([yeastgenome
  S000070200](https://www.yeastgenome.org/reference/S000070200), [pubmed:1943992](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992)).
  The carbon flow through the pathways is regulated primarily at the initial step
  and the branching points by the terminal end-products. The initial step of chorismate
  biosynthesis can be catalyzed by two isoenzymes Aro3p or Aro4p, whereby Aro3p is
  inhibited by phenylalanine, and Aro4p by tyrosine ([yeastgenome S000070200](https://www.yeastgenome.org/reference/S000070200),
  [pubmed:1943992](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992)). The first step in
  the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine and activated
  by tryptophan, and the first step in the tryptophan branch is feedback inhibited
  by tryptophan ([pubmed:1943992](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992)). The
  transcriptional activator GCN4 regulates most of the genes encoding for the aromatic
  amino acid biosynthetic enzymes; however, no GCN4 regulation was found for TYR1
  of the tyrosine branch, ARO7 of the tyrosine and phenylalanine branch or TRP1 of
  the tryptophan branch ([pubmed:1943992](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992)).   Source:
