description: 'Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine, and
  tryptophan proceeds via a common pathway to chorismate, at which point the pathway
  branches(https://www.yeastgenome.org/reference/S000070200, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992).
  One branch proceeds to tyrosine and phenylalanine, and the other to tryptophan (https://www.yeastgenome.org/reference/S000070200).
  The series of reactions to chorismate, called the shikimate pathway, and the series
  of reactions from chorismate to tryptophan have been found to be common to all eukaryotes
  and prokaryotes studied thus far (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992). In
  contrast, there appears to be two separate routes for tyrosine and phenylalanine
  biosynthesis from chorismate, only one of which has been found in S. cerevisiae
  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992). S. cerevisiae, similar to E. coli,
  synthesize tyrosine and phenylalanine via the intermediate 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
  and phenylpyruvate, respectively, whereas some other organisms synthesize them via
  arogenate (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992). Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis
  in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation
  of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis (https://www.yeastgenome.org/reference/S000070200,
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992). The carbon flow through the pathways
  is regulated primarily at the initial step and the branching points by the terminal
  end-products. The initial step of chorismate biosynthesis can be catalyzed by two
  isoenzymes Aro3p or Aro4p, whereby Aro3p is inhibited by phenylalanine, and Aro4p
  by tyrosine (https://www.yeastgenome.org/reference/S000070200, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992).
  The first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine
  and activated by tryptophan, and the first step in the tryptophan branch is feedback
  inhibited by tryptophan (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992). The transcriptional
  activator GCN4 regulates most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid
  biosynthetic enzymes; however, no GCN4 regulation was found for TYR1 of the tyrosine
  branch, ARO7 of the tyrosine and phenylalanine branch or TRP1 of the tryptophan
  branch (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943992).  SOURCE: SGD pathways, http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/server.html'
