description: This pathway is modeled after Figure 4 in the article "The ATM signaling
  network in development and disease" (See Bibliography).  When DNA is damaged, DDR
  begins to work on recuperating the damage through the appropriate cellular programs
  such as transcription, translation, etc etc. The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
  kinase acts as the main core of this pathway acting upon or receiving a lot of the
  reactions towards other gene products. ATM substrates use several different cell
  cycle checkpoints to determine the health of the DNA, and determine different types
  of disease/damage done to the DNA. The p38MAPK which is a reaction by ATM later
  leads to HSP27 which inhibits oxidative stress within the cell. DDR and ATM both
  work to help the cell recover from any damage it has received and understanding
  how ATM works will help increase doctors and scientists understanding of diseases,
  and their treatment.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via
  the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3878).
