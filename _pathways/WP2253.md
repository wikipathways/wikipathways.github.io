description: This pathway shows the relationship between BRAF signaling and the development
  and behavior of pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), normally induced by MAPK pathway activation.   BRAF
  is related in two alternative mechanisms in MAPK activation. The first is oncogenic
  fusion between SRGAP3 and RAF1, highlighted in yellow.  The second is a 3 basepair
  insertion in BRAF (KIAA1549), also highlighted in yellow.   This pathway is based
  on Figure 3 "An overview of MAPK pathway alterations in PAs" from [Jones et al](https://doi.org/10.1038/onc.2009.73).
