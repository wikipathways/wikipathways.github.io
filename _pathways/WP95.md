description: 'Pyrimidine nucleotides are essential as components of nucleic acids,
  as substrates for amino acid synthesis and as energy sources, but defects in the
  de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines are not lethal in S. cerevisiae cells.  This
  is because salvage pathways are able to utilize preformed bases (either from exogenous
  sources or internal turnover sources) for the synthesis of pyrimidines. If the required
  substrates are available, salvage pathways are preferred over de novo synthesis
  pathways for pyrimidine biosynthesis.    The salvage pathways of pyrimidine ribonucleotides
  consist of 1) importing exogenous bases into the cell, and 2) the interconversion
  of various bases. Three proteins are involved in the import of exogenous bases used
  by the salvage pathway for pyrimidine ribonucleotide biosynthesis. Uracil enters
  the cell via the Fur4p uracil permease, cytosine enters the cell via the Fcy2p purine-cytosine
  transporter, and uridine enters the cell via the Fui1p uridine permease.  As with
  many of the metabolic pathways of S. cerevisiae, the pathways for the salvage of
  pyrimidine ribonucleotides are under both transcriptional and post-transcriptional
  catabolite repression at a variety of points.  This pathway is of biomedical interest
  because cytosine deaminase (Fcy1p) is not found in mammals and is capable of catalyzing
  the deamination of the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) to form the anticancer drug
  5-fluorouracil (5FU). Expression of Fcy1p in tumor cells increases their sensitivity
  to 5FC, and expression of Fur1p increases tumor cell sensitivity to 5FU. Tumor cells
  expressing a novel chimeric protein, produced from a gene containing the FCY1 and
  FUR1 coding sequences fused in frame, display significantly increased sensitivity
  to 5-FC suggesting that this novel suicide gene may constitute an original and potent
  candidate therapeutic gene for cancer gene therapy.   SOURCE: [YeastPathways Salvage
