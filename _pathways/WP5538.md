description: 'Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, arises from a complex
  interplay of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers that disrupt the
  skin barrier. This dysfunction is exacerbated by alterations in the skin microbiome—particularly
  a reduction in Staphylococcus epidermidis and an overgrowth of Staphylococcus aureus—which
  increase the skin''s vulnerability to external allergens.  Keratinocytes, in response
  to this disruption, release epithelial-derived cytokines such as thymic stromal
  lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin (IL)-25, and IL-33. These cytokines promote type
  2 immune responses by activating group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), T helper
  2 (Th2) cells, and T follicular helper 2 (Tfh2) cells. These lymphocytes, stimulated
  by activated Langerhans cells (LCs) and inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells (IDECs),
  subsequently secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.  IL-4 and IL-13 signal through type
  I (IL-4Rα / CD132) and type II (IL-4Rα / IL-13Rα1) receptors expressed on B cells,
  keratinocytes, and sensory neurons, activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Tfh2
  cells promote class switching to IgE in B cells, enhancing mast cell and basophil
  activation via FcεRI. Concurrently, IL-4 and IL-13 reduce the production of antimicrobial
  peptides (AMPs), such as human β-defensin 3, in keratinocytes, further impairing
  the skin’s defense.  Pruritus (itch) is driven by IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-33, and
  TSLP, which stimulate sensory neurons and perpetuate the itch-scratch cycle. Type
  2 cytokines also worsen dysbiosis of the skin microbiota, while IL-5 recruits eosinophils,
  fueling ongoing inflammation.  Several immunotherapeutic agents have been developed
  to target these pathways:  * Dupilumab (brand name Dupixent) blocks IL-4Rα, inhibiting
  both type I and type II receptor signaling.  * Tralokinumab (Adbry, Adtralza) neutralizes
  IL-13.  * Nemolizumab (Nemluvio) targets the IL-31 receptor to reduce itch.  * Upadacitinib
  (Rinvoq) and abrocitinib (Cibinqo) are oral selective JAK1 inhibitors.  * Baricitinib
  (Olumiant) inhibits both JAK1 and JAK2.  * Topically, ruxolitinib (Jakafi, Jakavi,
  Opzelura; a JAK1/2 inhibitor) and delgocitinib (Corectim, a pan-JAK inhibitor) are
  approved for the treatment of AD.  Inspired by Figure 2 in [Song et al. (2022)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8901701/).'
