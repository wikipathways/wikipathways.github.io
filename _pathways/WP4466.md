  title: Transcriptional profiling and therapeutic targeting of oxidative stress in
    neuroinflammation (2020)
description: This pathway represents biology relevant to glutathione, including biosynthesis,
  metabolism, redox cycle, uptake, glutathionylation and acivicin inhibition.  Glutathione
  is an antioxidant that is synthesized in eukaryotes from L-cysteine, L-glutamic
  acid, and glycine in a two-step process involving gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase
  and glutathione synthetase. Glutathione prevents cellular damage by acting as an
  electron donor to neutralize reactive oxygen species. Reactive glutathione is produced,
  which then reacts with another reactive glutathione molecule to produce glutathione
  disulfide, GSSG. It was based partly on [[Pathway:WP164 |WP164]] and [[Pathway:WP1770|WP1770]],
  with information added from literature. This pathway was created as a part of [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-020-0654-0
  Mendiola et cl], pictured in fig 5.
