description: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision impairment
  in individuals aged 55 and older in the Western world.  This diagram shows metabolic
  pathway crosstalk in AMD.    In AMD, the upregulation of PARP2 expression leads
  to the downregulation of SIRT1. The depletion of SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase,
  causes acetylation and inactivation of PGC-1α. Reduced SIRT1 levels activate the
  TORC1 complex in AMD, which inhibits autophagy through phosphorylation-mediated
  suppression of Atg13 and ULK1. Additionally, activated mTOR enhances glycolysis.
  MAPK3 expression is reduced in AMD RPE cells, which can result in increased PMAIP1
  mRNA levels, leading to higher NOXA protein expression. NOXA promotes changes in
  the mitochondrial membrane and the release of apoptogenic proteins. MDH1, a key
  gene in energy metabolism, is upregulated in AMD RPE cells. This cytosolic enzyme
  plays an essential role in the malate-aspartate shuttle, allowing malate to pass
  through the mitochondrial membrane, and facilitates the NAD/NADH-dependent reversible
  oxidation of oxaloacetate to malate. In AMD RPE cells, reduced AMPK activity may
  disrupt both catabolic and anabolic processes, further downregulating PGC-1α and
  SIRT1.   Inspired by Figure 7 in [Zhang et al. (2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7016007/).
