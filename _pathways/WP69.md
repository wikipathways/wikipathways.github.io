description: The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex is composed of a ligand-binding
  subunit, the α and β chains, and a signaling subunit, namely the CD3ε, γ and δ chains
  and the TCRζ chain. This complex participates in T-cell activation upon the presentation
  of the antigen peptide (derived from the foreign antigen) bound to the MHC (Class
  I and Class II) residing on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic
  cells, macrophages and B cells. Co-stimulatory receptors, such as CD2, CD28, CD4,
  CD8, and integrin molecules, contribute to signal transduction by modulating the
  response threshold. All the above components along with accessory proteins essential
  for MHC are a part of the immunological synapse that initiates T-cell activation.  Protein
  tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn, in turn
  regulated by CD45, is the initial event in TCR signaling. Lck is activated by the
  interaction of MHC and CD4 or CD8. It then induces the phosphorylation and activation
  of TCR-CD3 complex and eventually mediates Fyn activation. The activated Src kinases
  phosphorylate ITAMs (Immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) present on
  CD3γ, δ, ε and ζ chain. The 70-kd ζ chain–associated protein kinase (ZAP70) is then
  recruited to the ITAMs followed by its phosphorylation and subsequent activation
  which results in further amplification of the response. These activated PTKs induce
  tyrosine phosphorylation of several polypeptides, including the transmembrane adaptor
  LAT (Linker Activator for T-Cells). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation subsequently
  leads to the activation of multiple pathways, including ERK (Extracellular Signal
  Regulated Kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal Kinase), NF-κB (Nuclear factor of kappa
  light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1) and NFAT(Nuclear Factor of Activated
  T-Cells) pathways, which ultimately induce effector functions.  CD28 ligation by
  B7-1 or B7-2 helps in bringing the T-Cell and Antigen Presenting Cell membranes
  into close proximity. This event also provides a co-stimulatory signal leading to
  the production of IL-2 and T- cell activation. Besides CD28, many other transmembrane
  receptors also modulate specific elements of TCR signaling. CD28 and CD45 activate
  Lck which in turn induces the phosphorylation and activation of the TCR-CD3 complex
  and consequently, the tyrosine kinases Fyn and ZAP70. CD45 plays a role in antagonizing
  the effect of inhibitory proteins on T-cell activation. ZAP70 induces activation
  of LAT (Linker for Activation of T-Cells), an integral membrane adaptor protein
  which further binds to GADS (Growth Factor Receptor-Bound Protein-2-Related Adaptor
  Protein-2), SLP76 (SH2 Domain-Containing Leukocyte Protein-76), and ITK (IL-2 inducible
  T-cell kinase). This complex facilitates the activation of PLCG1 (Phospholipase-C-Gamma1)
  that is responsible for the production of the second messengers DAG (Diacylglycerol)
  and IP3 (Inositol Triphosphate). DAG activates proteins including PKCθ (Protein
  Kinase-C-Theta) and Ras, whereas IP3 leads to Ca2+ release from ER and also facilitates
  influx of extracellular calcium. Increased intracellular Ca2+ activates the phosphatase
  Calcineurin that dephosphorylates NFAT which then enters the nucleus and promotes
  transcription.  Activated LAT also binds multiple adaptor proteins including GRB2,
  GRAP (GRB2- Related Adaptor Protein) and GADS to facilitate activation of serine/threonine
  kinases such as Raf1, MEK (MAPK/ERK Kinase) and dual-specificity kinases ERK1/2
  that are involved in activation of MAPKs (Mitogen activated protein kinases) resulting
  in the induction of transcription factor Elk1.  ZAP70 also activates IKKs via the
  CARD11 (Caspase recruitment domain family, member 11) -BCL10 (B-Cell CLL/lymphoma-10)-MALT1
  (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation Gene-1) complex and MAP3K
  (activated by PKCθ) which in turn relieve NF-κB of IκB (NF-kappa-B inhibitor beta)
  and allow its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. ZAP70 also activates
  p38 via Vav, Rac and MKK3/6 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-3 / Mitogen-Activated
  Protein Kinase Kinase-6). p38 then activates the transcription factor ATF2 (Activating
  Transcription Factor-2).  Activated Rac also activates JNK via MEKK1 and MKK4/7
  (MKK4 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-4/ Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase
  Kinase-7) which eventually leads to activation of c-Jun mediated transcription.  SIT
  (SHP2-Interacting Transmembrane Adaptor Protein) and CTLA4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte
  Antigen-4) are transmembrane adaptor proteins that interact with the SHP2 (SH2-containing
  Protein tyrosine Phosphatase-2) and negatively regulate T-cell activation by inhibiting
  the phosphorylation of Fyn and CD28 respectively. CTLA4 has a greater affinity for
  its B7-1/B7-2ligands in comparison toCD28 and thus competes for them. During T-cell
  activation CTLA4 is endocytosed to quicken the response. ZAP70 facilitates translocation
  of CTLA4 to the membrane when the response needs to be controlled. PAG (Phosphoprotein
  Associated with Glycosphingolipid Microdomains), a transmembrane adaptor molecule
  is associated with CSK (c-Src Tyrosine Kinase), an inhibitor of Src-related protein
  tyrosine kinases. Overexpression of PAG inhibits TCR-mediated responses.  Dual specificity
  phosphatase 3 (DUSP3) or VHR is also induced by ZAP70 which consequently down regulates
  ERK activation and thus controls T-cell response.  Please access this pathway at
