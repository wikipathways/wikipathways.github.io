description: Development and heterogeneity of the innate lymphoid cell (ILC) family.
  ILCs develop from distinct progenitors in the fetal liver or bone marrow and then
  develop into mature ILCs in the periphery. Different transcription factors and cytokines
  are involved in the development of the three groups of mature ILCs. All ILCs develop
  from CLPs, which can differentiate into NKps or CHILPs. CHILPs can further differentiate
  into LTi cells through α4β7+ populations or into other ILC populations through differentiation
  into ILCps. ILC1s express T-bet, are responsive to IL-12, and produce IFN-γ and/or
  TNF. ILC2s highly express GATA3, are responsive to IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, and produce
  IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13 and amphiregulin. ILC3s express ROR-γt, are responsive to
  IL-1β and IL-23, and produce IL-17 and/or IL-22.  Proteins on this pathway have
