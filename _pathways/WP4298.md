description: Viral myocarditis is a rare cardiac disease associated with the inflammation
  and injury of the myocardium. The downstream effects are a product of cooperation
  between viral processes and both the adaptive as innate host's immune response.
  Acute appearance of myocarditis is mostly idiopathic, i.e. of unknown origin. Primarily
  established on clinical observation and limited epidemiologic studies. Most studied
  cases are coxsackie, adeno and human immunodeficiency virus. Grey compartments describe
  extracellular matrix. Direct lines indicate downstream effects and dashed lines
  indicate speculative research.
