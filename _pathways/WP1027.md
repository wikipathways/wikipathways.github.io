description: Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into
  pyruvate, CH3COCOO− + H+. The free energy released in this process is used to form
  the ATP and NADH. Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation
  of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as pyruvate, lactate, glycerol,
  glucogenic amino acids, and fatty acids. Description adapted from [http://www.wikipedia.org
  Wikipedia].
