description: 'The allantoin degradation pathway, which converts allantoin to ammonia
  and carbon dioxide, allows S. cerevisiae to use allantoin as a sole nitrogen source.
  Conversion of allantoin to ammonia is carried out by the DAL1, DAL2, and DAL3 gene
  products, which work sequentially to generate urea (CITS: [3915539]).  Urea is then
  degraded to ammonia in a two-step process by the DUR1,2 protein, a multifunctional
  single enzyme originally thought to be encoded by two tightly-linked genes (hence
  the name DUR1,2; (CITS: [6105114]).  The allantoin catabolic pathway genes are regulated
  by a general signal that responds to the availability of readily utilizable nitrogen
  sources, and also by pathway-specific induction by allantoin or the intermediate
  allophanate.  These regulatory effects are mediated by cis-acting DNA elements and
  the trans-acting factors Gln3p, Gat1p, Dal80p, Dal81p, and Dal82p (CITS: [10488154])(CITS:
  [12062797])(CITS: [10702289])(CITS: [7899074]).  SOURCE: SGD pathways, http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/server.html'
