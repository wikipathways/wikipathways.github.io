description: Ether lipid biosynthesis in humans.  Ether lipids (e.g. plasmalogens),
  are peroxisome-derived glycerophospholipids where the hydrocarbon chain at the sn-1
  position of the glycerol backbone is attached by an ether bond (single bond between
  carbon and oxygen atom). Ether lipids are used to form non-lamellar inverted hexagonal
  structures in model membranes (indicating they could facilitate membrane fusion
  processes). Lipid raft microdomains (cholesterol-rich membrane regions involved
  in cellular signaling) rely on ether lipids for their organization and stability.
  [PMID:28523433].  The pathway knowledge depicted in this model stems from Robert
  C. Murphy, who endorsed version r123734.  Metabolic conversion missing an identifier
  from Rhea have been visualized with double line thickness.
