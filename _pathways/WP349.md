  title: Unraveling the blood transcriptome after real-life exposure of Wistar-rats
    to PM2.5, PM1 and water-soluble metals in the ambient air (2020)
description: 'Ketone bodies are three water-soluble compounds that are produced as
  by-products when fatty acids are broken down for energy in the liver and kidney.
  They are used as a source of energy in the heart and brain. In the brain, they are
  a vital source of energy during fasting.  Source: [[wikipedia:Ketone_bodies|Wikipedia]]'
