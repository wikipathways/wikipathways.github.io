description: 'Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a pathway that repairs double-strand
  breaks in DNA. NHEJ is referred to as "non-homologous" because the break ends are
  directly ligated without the need for a homologous template, in contrast to homologous
  recombination, which requires a homologous sequence to guide repair. NHEJ is evolutionarily
  conserved throughout all kingdoms of life and is the predominant double-strand break
  repair pathway in mammalian cells.  Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-homologous_end_joining).'
