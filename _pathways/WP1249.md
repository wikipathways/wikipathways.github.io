  title: Hematopoietic stem-cell senescence and myocardial repair - Coronary artery
    disease genotype/phenotype analysis of post-MI myocardial regeneration response
    induced by CABG/CD133+ bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell treatment in RCT PERFECT
    Phase 3 (2020)
description: 'The erythropoietin receptor is a 66 kDa peptide and is a member of the
  cytokine receptor family. The receptor is tyrosine phosphorylated upon binding by
  erythropoietin and associates with and activates the tyrosine kinase, JAK2, which
  activates different intracellular pathways including: Ras/MAP kinase, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase and STAT transcription factors. The stimulated erythropoietin receptor
  appears to have a role in erythroid cell survival. Defects in the erythropoietin
  receptor may produce erythroleukemia and familial erythrocytosis. ''''Source: [[wikipedia:Erythropoietin_receptor|Wikipedia]]''''  This
  pathway is based on ScienceSlides.'
