description: 'The mammary gland development can be subdivided into four stages of
  development: (1) embryonic development, (2) puberty, (3) pregnancy and lactation
  and (4) involution. In the embryonic development, a pair of mammary lines (ectoderm)
  arises, which gives origin to a pair of placodes. Then, each placode penetrates
  the underlying mesoderm. This results in the formation of the primary mammary gland
  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14668814 3]. NRG3 is a signal for placode formation.
  Besides that, it influences cell fate: it binds to its receptor, ERBB4, and induces
  MYC, which decreases expression of the integrins ITGA6 and ITGB1. The result is
  a change in cell adhesion and proliferation and consequent exit from the stem cell
  compartment [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17880691 1]. Another process that
  should be highlighted in the embryonic development is the epithelial to mesenchymal
  transition (EMT). ZEB2 is an EMT regulator. It represses many genes (eg. CCND1,
  SFRP1, MIR200A, MIR200B, MIR429, TERT, CDH1, CLDN4 and ALPL), and also upregulates
  mesenchymal markers [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19424592 2]. CCND1 and SFRP1
  are related to cell proliferation, and SFRP1 are also related to WNT signaling pathway.
  MIR200A, MIR200B and MIR429 are microRNAs. TERT is responsible for elongation of
  telomere ends. CDH1 and CLDN4 are associated with cell adhesion, and ALPL may play
  a role in skeletal mineralization. Many genes modulate ZEB2. Some of these are shown
  in the figure [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19424592 2]. TGFB1, TNF and IL1
  are cytokines and AKT1 plays a role in many processes like cell proliferation, survival
  and growth. Hedgehog signals upregulate ZEB2 via TGFB1 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19424592
  2].'
