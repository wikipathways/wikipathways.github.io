description: This pathway is inspired by the LIPID MAPS>Eicosanoids Pathway expended
  pathway display [https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps] and extended with
  the bottom left side of Figure 1 from Dennis and Norris (2015 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26139350]).
  Eicosanoids are a large group of compounds metabolised from arachidonic acid (AA),
  either via cyclooxygenases (COX)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4347],
  lipooxygenases(LOX)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4348], or cytochrome
  P450 monooxygenases (CYP)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4349].
  This pathway visualises the third route, via CYP.  Orange boxes represent peroxisome-proliferator
  activating receptors (PPARs) potentially activated by the eicosanoids.
