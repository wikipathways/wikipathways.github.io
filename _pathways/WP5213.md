description: Amino acid metabolism in triple-negative breast cancer cells. The glutamine,
  serine and glycine metabolic pathways are significantly upregulated. The upregulated
  expression of key genes within the glutamine, serine and glycine metabolic pathways
  have also been observed in triple-negative breast cancer cells
