description: 'This pathway visualises the Moco biosynthesis, which is used as a cofactor
  for several enzymes. Several diseases (MoCD type A, B and C) are clinically very
  similar to sulphite oxidase (SO) deficiency (see [WP4504](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4504)
  for the pathway related to SO-deficiency). This pathway was inspired by Chapter
  12 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)). '
