description: 'IL-10 binds to its respective IL-10 receptor which activates the JAK/STAT
  pathway and MAPK pathway involving the p38 kinases. This leads to the induction
  of the enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) which is involved in the biosynthesis of
  heme, and catalyzes the reaction producing the heme precursor biliverdin. The ani-inflammatory
  actions of HMOX appear to be the result of signaling by carbon monoxide which inhibits
  pro-inflammatory cytokine production. '
