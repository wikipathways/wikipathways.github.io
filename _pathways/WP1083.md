description: 'The cell cycle is the series of events that takes place in a cell leading
  to its division and duplication (replication). Regulation of the cell cycle involves
  processes crucial to the survival of a cell, including the detection and repair
  of genetic damage as well as the prevention of uncontrolled cell division. Two key
  classes of regulatory molecules, cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), determine
  a cell''s progress through the cell cycle.   Sources: [Wikipedia:Cell cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle),
