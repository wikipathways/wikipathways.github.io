description: 'Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter
  and a psychoactive drug. This compound is a precursor to GABA, glutamate, and glycine
  in certain brain areas, acts on the GHB receptor and is a weak agonist at the GABAB
  receptor. GHB has been used in a medical setting as a general anesthetic and as
  a treatment for cataplexy, narcolepsy, and alcoholism. It is also used illegally
  as an intoxicant, to try to increase athletic performance, and as a date rape drug.
  GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation, and is found in small quantities
  in some beers and wines, beef and small citrus fruits. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  deficiency is a disease that causes GHB to accumulate in the blood.  Part of this
  pathway was inspired by Edition 5, Chapter 24 (Fig.24.2) of the book of Blau (ISBN
  9783030677268) (Ed.4 Chapter 5, Fig. 5.3). '
