description: This pathway shows the molecular pathophysiology of sickle cell disease.    (A)
  A single–nucleotide variant in the β-globin gene replaces glutamic acid with valine
  at position 6 of the β-globin chain. Upon deoxygenation, the resulting hemoglobin
  S (HbS) molecules polymerize into rigid fibers, driving erythrocyte sickling (clockwise).   (B)
  Sickled cells cause impaired blood rheology and enhanced adhesion of erythrocytes
  to neutrophils, platelets, and the endothelium, leading to slowed or obstructed
  microvascular flow -- called vaso-occlusion. Vaso-occlusion in turn promotes ischemia-reperfusion
  (I-R) injury (clockwise).  (C) HbS polymer formation also leads to red cell membrane
  damage and hemolysis (counterclockwise), releasing cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) into
  circulation. Oxygenated Hb (Fe²⁺) contributes to endothelial dysfunction by consuming
  nitric oxide (NO) and producing nitrate (NO₃⁻) and methemoglobin (Fe³⁺). Hb can
  also undergo Fenton chemistry with H₂O₂, generating hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and
  additional methemoglobin. Methemoglobin (Fe³⁺) can degrade and release cell-free
  heme (counterclockwise), a potent erythrocyte-derived DAMP.  (D) ROS production,
  TLR4 activation, NET formation, release of tissue- or cell-derived DAMPs, extracellular
  DNA, and other yet-undefined mediators generated by cell-free heme or I-R injury
  can induce sterile inflammation by activating the inflammasome in vascular and immune
  cells, leading to IL-1β release. Sterile inflammation then reinforces vaso-occlusion
  through a positive feedback loop that increases neutrophil, platelet, and endothelial
  adhesiveness.  Inspired by figure 1 in [Sundd 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7053558/#S2).
