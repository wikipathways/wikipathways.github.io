description: 'The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a catabolic pathway that functions
  to generate energy and reduced cofactors from the oxidative decarboxylation of acetyl
  (C2) units. It occupies a central role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms, enabling
  the production of energy from carbohydrates, fatty acids, amino acids, and potentially
  any other molecule that can be converted or broken down to acetyl-CoA. In addition
  to its role in catabolism, the TCA cycle can also serve a biosynthetic role, as
  several intermediates in the pathway (e.g. oxaloacetate, succinate) provide carbon
  for the synthesis of amino acids or other biological compounds.  Source: https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/'
