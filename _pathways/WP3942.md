description: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone
  receptors that are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. PPAR has three
  subtypes (PPARalpha, beta/delta, and gamma) showing different expression patterns
  in vertebrates. Each of them is encoded in a separate gene and binds fatty acids
  and eicosanoids. PPARalpha plays a role in the clearance of circulating or cellular
  lipids via the regulation of gene expression involved in lipid metabolism in liver
  and skeletal muscle. PPARbeta/delta is involved in lipid oxidation and cell proliferation.
  PPARgamma promotes adipocyte differentiation to enhance blood glucose uptake.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3942
