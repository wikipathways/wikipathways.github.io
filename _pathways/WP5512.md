description: '"Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with a predominantly
  gastrointestinal effect. It specifically inhibits leucocyte integrin α4β7, thus
  preventing its interaction with mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule
  1 (MAdCAM-1), which is involved in the migration of lymphocytes from the blood stream
  to the intestinal tissue. Vedolizumab is indicated in the treatment of moderate
  to severe active Crohn''s disease and ulcerative colitis in adult patients with
  poor response, loss of response, or intolerance to conventional treatment or to
  tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antagonists."  Inspired by Figure 1 in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31470005/.  Vedolizumab
  is also known by its trade name, Entyvio.'
