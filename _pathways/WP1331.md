  title: 'Heart Failure Phenotypes Induced by Knockdown of DAPIT in Zebrafish: A New
    Insight into Mechanism of Dilated Cardiomyopathy (2017)'
description: The different classess of factors involved in adipogenesis are shown.
  Adipogenesis is the process by which fat cells differentiate from predadipocytes
  to adipocytes (fat cells). Adipose tissue, composed of white and brown adipose tissue,
  is composed of adipocytes. This pathway is primarily studied to understand factors
  that contribute to obesity and diabetes. Transcriptional and hormonal regulators
  of adipocyte formation are indicated.
