description: Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson
  classification. Type IV familial hyperlipidemia is also known as familial hypertriglyceridemia.
  Typ IV is mostly linked to in increased VLDL within the blood. This is from both
  an increased production as well as a decreased elimination of VLDL.  The increased
  production is caused by mutations of GCKR. This gene inhibits glucokinase, which
  would lead to less triglycerides produced in the liver. These triglycerides would
  then increase the amount of VLDL in the blood. Mutations in GCKR would therefore
  lead to increased VLDL.  A decreased elimination is caused by APOA5. APOA5 plays
  a role in the hydrolysis of VDLD by LPL. Mutations in this gene would therefore
  lead to a decrease of this hydrolysis.
