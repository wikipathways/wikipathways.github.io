description: 'This pathway describes the metabolism of retinol. Retinol, more common
  known as vitamin A, is involved in various physiological processes in the human
  body.  Vitamin A must acquired from the diet. When taken up, retinol metabolism
  is important to create all the different retinoid forms, such as retinoic acid and
  retinyl esters. All these types have their own function.   There are many carries
  proteins and enzymes specific to retinoid metabolism involved in the processes. '
