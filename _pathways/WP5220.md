description: 'This pathway model displays the interactions between KRAS and TP53 mutations
  and pancreatic cancer cells. As a consequence of these mutations, the cell undergoes
  reprogramming of glucose, lipid and amino acid metabolism, thereby affecting the
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle. The pathway curation is largely based on Figure 2 of the review
  article by Wang et al. in 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00659-4). '
