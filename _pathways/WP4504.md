description: This pathway visualises the conversion of methionine to cysteine, after
  which it is further metabolised in either an oxidative or non-oxidative manner.
  Several of these metabolites are altered in people suffering from MoCD and SO; changes
  in metabolite concentrations (comparing MoCD cases to controls) are highlighted
  in blue (see [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4507] for the pathway
  on MoCD). This pathway was inspired by Chapter 12 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360
  (978-3642403361)).
