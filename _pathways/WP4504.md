description: 'This pathway visualizes the conversion of methionine to cysteine, after
  which it is further metabolized in either an oxidative or non-oxidative manner.
  Several of these metabolites are altered in people suffering from MoCD and SO; changes
  in metabolite concentrations (comparing MoCD cases to controls) are highlighted
  in blue (see [WP4507](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4507) for
  the pathway on MoCD). This pathway was inspired by Chapter 12 of the book of Blau
  (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)). '
