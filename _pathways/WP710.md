description: This is one of two pathways that deal with DNA damage. It has two central
  gene products (ATM and TP53) which are connected with the [[Pathway:WP707|other
  DNA damage response pathway]]. In this pathway there is only one source of DNA damage
  induction, since most DNA damage induction sources and their involvement are mentioned
  in the [[Pathway:WP707|first DNA damage response pathway]]. If it is not mentioned
  differently, the processes take place in the cell cytoplasm. The purpose of this
  pathway is to report more gene products and cell condition changes through the DNA
  damage response pathway and at the same time keep them clearly arranged.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP710
