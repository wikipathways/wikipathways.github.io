description: 'The main mechanism of 5-FU activation is conversion to fluorodeoxyuridine
  monophosphate (FdUMP), which inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TYMS). TYMS
  is an important part of the folate-homocysteine cycle and purine and pyrimidine
  synthesis. The conversion of 5-FU to FdUMP can occur via thymidylate phosphorylase
  (TYMP) to fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) and then by the action of thymidine kinase to
  FdUMP; or indirectly via fluorouridine monophosphate (FUMP) or fluroridine (FUR)
  to fluorouridine diphosphate (FUDP) and then ribonucleotide reductase action to
  FdUDP and FdUMP. FUDP and FdUDP can also be converted to FUTP and FdUTP and incorporated
  into RNA and DNA respectively which also contributes to the pharmacodynamic actions
  of fluoropyrimidines.  Sources: [PharmGKB:Fluoropyrimidine Pharmacokinetics](https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA150653776),
