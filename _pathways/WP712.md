description: 'Estrogen receptor refers to a group of receptors which are activated
  by the hormone 17-beta-estradiol (estrogen). Two types of estrogen receptor exist:
  ER which is a member of the nuclear hormone family of intracellular receptors and
  the estrogen G protein coupled receptor GPR30 (GPER), which is a G-protein coupled
  receptor. The main function of the estrogen receptor is as a DNA binding transcription
  factor which regulates gene expression. However the estrogen receptor also has additional
  functions independent of DNA binding.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays
  available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP712).'
