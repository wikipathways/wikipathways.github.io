description: Thyroxine hormone is produced in the thyroid gland from tyrosine and
  iodine. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is produced by the hypothalamus. It
  stimulates the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the anterior pituitary
  gland, which affects the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). Iodine is
  captured by a hydrogen peroxide trap procuced by thyroid peroxidase and added to
  the 3' and 5' postitions of tyrosine. This can either be free tyrosine or a tyrosine
  residue in thyroglobuline. After the multiple iodination steps this produces T3
  and T4.  The production of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4),tri-iodothyronine
  (T3) and reverse T3 (rT3) is dependent on the organification of iodine into thyroglobulin
  (Tg), the major protein product of the thyroid (2). This involves thyroid peroxidase
  catalyzed iodination of tyrosine residues in Tg to form mono- and di-iodotyrosines
  and their subsequent crosslinking to form the iodothyronines T3 and T4.  Iodine
  131 is an important radioactive fallout product. It was released in the atmosphere
  after nuclear tests and after nuclear incidents like at Tchernobyl and Fukushima.
  Since the iodine is concentrated in the thyroid glant as a substrate for the process
  described here non-radioactive iodine 127 is given as competitor to people exposed.
