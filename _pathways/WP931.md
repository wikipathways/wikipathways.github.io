description: 'G proteins, short for guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, are a family
  of proteins involved in second messenger cascades. G proteins are so called because
  they function as "molecular switches". They alternate from ''inactive'' guanosine
  diphosphate (GDP) to ''active'' guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a binding
  state, and which proceeds to regulate downstream cell processes.  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein)'
