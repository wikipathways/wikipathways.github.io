description: Taken from The role of Notch in patterning the human vertebral column
  by [Sally L Dunwoodie](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19608404) and The many
  roles of Notch signaling during vertebrate somitogenesis by [Kanu Wahi, Matthew
  S. Bochter, Susan E. Cole](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25483003).  Spondylocostal
  dysostosis-associated genes refine Notch1 signaling in the anterior presomitic mesoderm
  in mammalian somitogenesis. Interaction between Notch pathway components. Dll1 activates
  Notch1 signaling producing N1ICD, and Dll3 inhibits Notch1 signaling. N1ICD activates
  transcription of Mesp2, Lfng and Hes7. Hes7 protein inhibits its own transcription
  and that of Lfng. The effect of Lfng on Notch1 signaling is contradictory; it can
  potentiate Notch1 signaling in cultured mammalian cells, and inhibit signaling in
  the embryo. Mesp2 protein activates the transcription of Lfng, Ripply2 and Epha4.
  Ripply2 inhibits the transcription of Mesp2 and Epha4 is implicated in somite border
  formation in zebrafish but is not required for this in mouse.  Linked with a dotted
  arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective
  gene.
