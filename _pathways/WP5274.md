description: 'Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone or CoQ) is an essential lipid in electron transport
  and an important antioxidant. CoQ synthesis derives from the isoprene biosynthetic
  pathway in human and yeast cells. There is interest in the use of CoQ10 in particular
  for the treatment of mitochondrial disorders and neurodegenerative diseases [PMID:
