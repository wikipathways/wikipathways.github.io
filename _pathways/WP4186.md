description: The somatotrophic axis in mammals comprises the growth hormone (GH),
  which is produced by the anterior pituitary, and its secondary mediator, insulin-like
  growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The intracellular signaling pathway of IGF-1 is the same
  as that elicited by insulin, which informs cells of the presence of glucose. For
  this reason, IGF-1 and insulin signaling are known as the insulin and IGF-1 signaling
  (IIS) pathway. Remarkably, the IIS pathway is the most conserved aging-controlling
  pathway in evolution, and among its multiple targets are the FOXO family of transcription
  factors and the mTOR complexes, which are also involved in aging and conserved through
  evolution. Genetic polymorphisms or mutations that reduce the functions of GH, IGF-1
  receptor, insulin receptor, or downstream intracellular effectors such as AKT, mTOR,
  and FOXO have been linked to longevity. Molecules that favor aging are shown in
  orange, and molecules with anti-aging properties are shown in light green.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4186
  CPTAC Assay Portal].
