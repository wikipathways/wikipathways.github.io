description: 'Picture from Research article: "Jozefczak M., E. Keunen, H. Schat, M.
  Bliek, L.E. Hernández, R. Carleer, T. Remans, S. Bohler, J. Vangronsveld, and A.
  Cuypers, Differential response of Arabidopsis leaves and roots to cadmium: Glutathione-related
  chelating capacity vs antioxidant capacity. Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 2014.
  83: p. 1-9."  Caption: Fig. 8. Schematic overview of four studied processes, all
  activated under Cd stress: GSH biosynthesis, Cd chelation, SOD regulation and the
  AsA-GSH cycle. There are several indications that the GSH state, including both
  total GSH content and GSH:GSSG ratio, is involved in the stimulation of these pathways.
  Data of roots and leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to 5 or 10 mM CdSO4 for
  different time periods (2, 24, 48, 72 h) are visualised (significant upregulation,
  green box; significant downregulation, red box; ANOVA). Data from in-gel activities
  are presented by and for increased and decreased SOD activity according to visual
  quantification. Abbreviations: cadmium (Cd), glutathione (GSH), GSH disulfide (GSSG),
  gglutamylcysteine (g-EC), g-EC synthetase (GSH1), GSH synthetase (GSH2), phytochelatin
  (PC), PC synthase (PCS1), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ascorbate (AsA), AsA peroxidase
  (APX1, APX2), monodehydroascorbate (MDHA), MDHA reductase (MDHAR), dehydroascorbate
  (DHA), DHA reductase (DHAR), GSH reductase (GR), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH, NADPþ), superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms: manganese (MSD1,
  MnSOD), iron (FSD1, FeSOD) and copper/zinc (CSD1, CSD2, CuZnSOD); microRNA398 (miR398a,
  miR398b/c), copper chaperones (CCH, ATX1, CCS).'
