description: 'Ovarian &amp;#x2019;bottleneck&amp;#x2019; genes associated with infertility
  &amp;#xD; A valuable approach to the study of infertility is the comparison of mutations
  of individual human and mouse genes associated with infertility phenotypes. The
  individual gene pages in the OKdb (Ovarian Kaleidoscope Database: http://ovary.stanford.edu)
  contain information on associated fertility phenotypes sorted by ovarian and nonovarian
  defects and by subfertility or infertility. If one searches for null mutations (under
  &amp;#x2019;mutation type&amp;#x2019;) causing infertility (&amp;#x2019;infertile
  - ovarian defect&amp;#x2019;, under &amp;#x2019;female fertility status&amp;#x2019;)
  in mice (under &amp;#x2019;species&amp;#x2019;), 44 gene entries are found. The
  expression of these infertility genes in the oocyte and granulosa cells together
  with their cellular localization is presented in Ovarian Infertility gene map. The
  theca cell genes are not presented because most publications emphasize granulosa
  cell studies.&amp;#xD;'
