  title: Enhanced glucose metabolism through activation of HIF-1α covers the energy
    demand in a rat embryonic heart primordium after heartbeat initiation (2022)
communities: []
description: Muscle contraction is the process where muscle tissue is activated by
  a signal from the nervous system. In the case of voluntary action, the nervous signals
  are initiated from the brain by so-called action potentials. With reflexes, these
  potentials are coming directly from the spinal cord. Striated muscles are a group
  of muscles also called skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue.
