description: Immune checkpoints are hardwired into the immune system and are crucial
  for maintaining self-tolerance. Tumors can use these checkpoints to protect themselves
  from immune system attacks.  CTLA-4 is expressed on T cells and is a negative regulator
  of T cell activation. CTLA4 counteracts the activity of the T cell co-stimulatory
  receptor, CD28, which amplifies TCR signaling once antigen is bound. CTLA-4 and
  CD28 share the same ligands, CD80 and CD86, although CTLA-4 has a higher affinity.
  This is represented in the pathway with a blue inhibitory interaction.  One strategy
  for cancer immunotherapy is to block CTLA-4, thereby removing the negative regulation
  on T-cell activation. The first checkpoint antibody approved by the FDA was ipilimumab,
  approved in 2011 for treatment of melanoma.   The [2018 Nobel prize in Physiology
  or Medicine](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2018/summary/) was awarded
  to jointly to James Allison and Tasuku Honjo for their discovery of cancer therapy
  by inhibition of negative immune regulation.  Partially based on Thermo Fisher [CTLA4
  Signaling Pathway](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/antibodies/antibodies-learning-center/antibodies-resource-library/cell-signaling-pathways/ctla4-signaling-pathway.html)
