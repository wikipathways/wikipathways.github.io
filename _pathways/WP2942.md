description: Posttranscriptional maturation is a critical step in microRNA (miRNA)
  biogenesis that determines mature miRNA levels. In addition to core components (Drosha
  and DGCR8 [DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8]) in the microprocessor, regulatory
  RNA-binding proteins may confer the specificity for recruiting and processing of
  individual primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). Here, we identify DDX1 as a regulatory protein
  that promotes the expression of a subset of miRNAs, including five members in the
  microRNA-200 (miR-200) family and four miRNAs in an eight-miRNA signature of a mesenchymal
  ovarian cancer subtype. A majority of DDX1-dependent miRNAs are induced after DNA
  damage. This induction is facilitated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated
  phosphorylation of DDX1. Inhibiting DDX1 promotes ovarian tumor growth and metastasis
  in a syngeneic mouse model. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that
  low DDX1 levels are associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with serous
  ovarian cancer. These findings suggest that DDX1 is a key modulator in miRNA maturation
  and ovarian tumor suppression.  This pathway is based on the graphical abstract
  from http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(14)00660-3.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2942
