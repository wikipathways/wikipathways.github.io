description: 'The utilization of ammonia to synthesize glutamate occurs through two
  pathways in most microorganisms. In the first pathway, glutamate is synthesized
  through the reductive amination of -ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase. Two
  NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenases exist in S. cerevisiae: Gdh1p and Gdh3p.
  GDH1 is highly expressed when either ethanol or glucose is used as the carbon source,
  whereas GDH3 is glucose-repressed and induced only in ethanol. The second route
  of glutamate biosynthesis involves the combined action of glutamine synthetase (Gln1p)
  and glutamate synthase (Glt1p). In the first step, glutamate reacts with a molecule
  of ammonia in a reaction catalyzed by Gln1p to form glutamine. In the second, glutamine
  reacts with -ketoglutarate via Glt1p to form two molecules of glutamate, resulting
  in a net gain of one for each glutamate molecule that enters the pathway. Source:
