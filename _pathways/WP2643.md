description: Nanoparticle-mediated activation of receptor signaling. Several NP formulations
  were shown to interact with cellular receptors such as the EGFR and integrins, inducing
  cellular phenotypes such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and migration.
  In lung epithelial cells, NPs interact with both EGFR and integrins, leading to
  cell proliferation via activation of PI3K and AKT. NPs were shown to activate the
  EGFR, leading in parallel to apoptosis and proliferation, and oncogenic Ras mutations
  might influence these effects. Interestingly, while integrin-mediated activation
  of ERK was instrumental for proliferation, apoptosis was mediated via activation
  of JNK. In addition, NPs (PM2.5) are able to bind the EGFR to activate the MAPK
  signaling cascade. Activation of ERK leads to the expression and secretion of the
  epidermal growth factor amphiregulin, thus forming an autocrine loop, which might
  be instrumental for sustained inflammatory responses. Nanoparticles are depicted
  as red circles.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the
  [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2643 CPTAC Assay Portal]
