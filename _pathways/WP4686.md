description: This pathway shows disorders related to leucine, isoleusine and valine
  metabolism. These three substrates are part of a group of chemicals called Branched-chain
  amino acids (BCAAs), which are essential nutrients and can be found in meat, dairy,
  and legumes. BCAAs stimulate the building of protein in muscle and possibly reduce
  muscle breakdown. Disorders resulting from an enzyme defect are highlighted in pink.  This
  pathway was inspired by Chapter 7 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
