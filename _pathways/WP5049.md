description: 'Glycolysis appears to be upregulated in most senescent phenotypes. This
  is hypothesized to match with the increased need for proteins and lipids needed
  for senescence-associated events such as extracellular secretions (SASP) and cell
  enlargement (Wiley & Campisi, 2016). It is also supposed to cause an increase in
  NF-κB signalling and cause inflammatory cascades associated with senescence. Glycolysis
  is also responsible for increased lactate production by producing pyruvate, along
  with several other mechanisms including upregulated lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA),
  pyruvate kinase (PKM), serinolysis and glutaminolysis. Pyruvate kinase (PKM) is
  responsible for the last conversion step of glycolysis, producing pyruvate. The
  enzyme is upregulated in replicative senescence and leads to increased TCA activity
  and oxygen consumption rate (Sabbatinelli et al., 2019). Findings were similar in
  another study on oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) (Dörr et al., 2013). PKM is also
  thought to increase lactate production indirectly (Zwerschke et al., 2003). In parallel,
  lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) is also upregulated, which leads to this increase in
  lactate levels in senescent cells. Senescence induced by oncogenes also has an impact
  on serinolysis and glutaminolysis. These are processes in which serine and glutamine
  are consumed to produce energy. They usually take place in tumour cells as an alternative
  source of energy, and produce lactate (among others) as a by-product. It has been
  found that both processes are increased in OIS, and lead to increases in lactate
  levels (Mazurek et al., 2001). Such increased levels of lactate lead to several
  events associated with senescence, such as tumorigenesis, wound healing and evasion
  from immune responses (Nacarelli & Sell, 2017).   The upregulation of several glycolytic
  enzymes seems to mediate increased glycolysis in various types of induced senescence.
  Depending on the stimulus, various proteins and genes influence glycolytic rates.
  For example, in irradiation-induced senescence, this effect seems to be mediated
  by AMPK activation and NF-kB signalling (Nacarelli & Sell, 2017). Similarly, in
  OIS, the retinoblastoma protein appears to upregulate glycolytic genes (Nacarelli
  & Sell, 2017). The very important p53 is known to be a central mediator of senescence,
  due to its role in cell cycle regulation. It has been found to negatively affect
  glycolysis (Gu et al., 2018). However it also has an indirect positive effect on
  it, by activating G6PDH in stressed cells (Jiang et al., 2011). TP53 is therefore
  thought to have a regulatory role on glycolysis and is interesting in the context
  of senescence.  While most glycolytic enzymes are upregulated (Zwerschke et al.,
  2003), GAPDH seems to decrease. This may partially be explained by the sensitivity
  of the enzyme to oxidative stress. '
