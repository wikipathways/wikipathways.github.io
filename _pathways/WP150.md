description: 'DNA replication, the basis for biological inheritance, is a fundamental
  process occurring in all living organisms to copy their DNA. This process is "replication"
  in that each strand of the original double-stranded DNA molecule serves as template
  for the reproduction of the complementary strand. Hence, following DNA replication,
  two identical DNA molecules have been produced from a single double-stranded DNA
  molecule. Cellular proofreading and error-checking mechanisms ensure near perfect
  fidelity for DNA replication.  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication).'
