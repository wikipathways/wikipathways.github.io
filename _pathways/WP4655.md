description: As part of the innate immune system, specific cytosolic pattern recognition
  receptors recognize DNA from invading viruses and bacteria. These receptors have
  specificity for certain pathogens.  The three receptors that recognize double-stranded
  cytosolic DNA are CGAS (GMP-AMP Synthase), ZBP1 (DAI) and AIM. CGAS signals via
  STING (TREM173) and eventually results in expression of type I interferons. ZBP1
  activates NFkb and IRF transcription factors which results in expression of interferons
  and cytokines/chemokines. Activation of AIM leads to the formation of the inflammasome
  complex, which activates caspase-1 and triggers a form of apoptosis known as pyroptosis.   In
  addition to sensors that directly detect DNA, another mechanism exists where the
  foreign DNA is first translated into RNA by host polymerase. The RNA is then recognized
  by the RNA sensor RIG-I, which leads to NFkb and IRF activation.
