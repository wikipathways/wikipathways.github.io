description: 'Complex II or succinate dehydrogenase (quinone) is shared between the
  TCA cycle and the ETC. It has no proton pumping activity. It is composed of four  subunits
  encoded by nDNA. Two subunits are hydrophillic, SDHA and SDHB, and two subunits
  are hydrophobic: SDHC and SDHD. Complex II assembly occurs through the independent
  maturation of these subunits mediated by subunit-specific chaperones.'
