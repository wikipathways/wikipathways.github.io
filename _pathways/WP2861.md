description: This plant pathway represents the photosynthetic electron transport chain
  (chloroplast). Ligh is absorbed by photosystem II and electrons are released and
  transported through the chain and finally used by ferredoxin NADP+ reductase to
  reduce NADP+ into NADPH. The electron transport generates a proteom gradient that
  powers an ATPase to generate ATP. Both NADPH and ATP produced by this process are
  mostly used by the Calvin cycle (WP2860).
