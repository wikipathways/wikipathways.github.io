description: The Na/K-ATPase, or Na+ pump, is a member of the P-type ATPase superfamily.
  In addition to pumping ions, Na/K-ATPase is engaged in assembly of multiple protein
  complexes that transmit signals to different intracellular compartments. The signaling
  function of the enzyme appears to have been acquired through the evolutionary incorporation
  of many specific binding motifs that interact with proteins and ligands. In some
  cell types the signaling Na/K-ATPase and its protein partners are compartmentalized
  in caveolae. Na/K-ATPase can bind with Src kinase and keep it inactive. However,
  binding of ouabain or other digitalis compound to Na/K-ATPase activates the cytoplasmic
  tyrosine kinase Src, resulting in the formation of an active "binary receptor" that
  phosphorylates and assembles other proteins into different signaling modules. This
  in turn activates multiple protein kinase cascades including mitogen-activated protein
  kinases and protein kinase C isozymes in a cell-specific manner. It also increases
  mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)and regulates intracellular
  calcium concentration. Crosstalk among the activated pathways eventually results
  in changes in the expression of a number of genes. Part of the pathway was adopted
  and edited from wikipathway WP85.
