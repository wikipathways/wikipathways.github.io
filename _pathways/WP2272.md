description: 'Escherichia coli (commonly abbreviated E. coli) is a gram-negative,
  rod-shaped bacterium that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded
  organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes are
  pathogenic and can cause serious food poisoning in humans, and are occasionally
  responsible for product recalls. E. coli are also responsible for a majority of
  cases of urinary tract infections. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora
  of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2, and by preventing
  the establishment of pathogenic bacteria within the intestine.  Sources: [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa05130.html)  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2272)'
