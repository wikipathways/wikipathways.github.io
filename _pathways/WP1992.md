description: This catalog pathway was created using the database from "http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/tarbase/"
  with exclusions based on evidence type. This pathway only includes miR targeted
  genes expressed in adipocyte cells. This pathway is meant for data mapping.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1992
  CPTAC Assay Portal].
