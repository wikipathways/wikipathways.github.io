description: Ethylene signal transduction and the control of juvenile to adult phase
  transitions in the leaf. The pathway for ethylene signal transduction involves positive
  and negative regulators that culminate in transcriptional regulation by the EIN3-like
  family of transcription factors. Among the ethylene-responsive genes are some that
  encode additional transcription factors such as those of the ethylene response factor
  (ERF) and ethylene response DNA-binding factor (EDF) families. The pharmacological
  agents aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) and silver can be used to inhibit ethylene
  responses through their ability to target ethylene biosynthesis or the receptors,
  respectively. One effect of ethylene is to stimulate the juvenile to adult phase
  transition of leaves. The transcription factor FUS3 negatively regulates the effects
  of ethylene on this developmental process.
