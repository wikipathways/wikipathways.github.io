description: 'This is the first of two pathways which deals with the DNA damage response.
  It comprises two central gene products (ATM and ATR) influenced by different sources
  of DNA damage (in blue). The two central genes can both be divides into their most
  important genes. For the ATM pathway these are TP53 and CHEK2, while CHEK1 is most
  important for the ATR pathway. The goal of this first pathway is to provide an overview
  of the most important gene products, processes and changes in cell condition elicited
  by the DNA damage response while keeping it clear and understandable. Also some
  microRNAs are implemented to visualize the possible effects they can induce. By
  doing so a better understanding of the role microRNA play in the DNA damage response
  might arise.  All processes take place in the cytoplasm, except when mentioned differently.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1530
  CPTAC Assay Portal]. '
