  title: DNA methylation of ARHGAP30 is negatively associated with ARHGAP30 expression
    in lung adenocarcinoma, which reduces tumor immunity and is detrimental to patient
    survival (2021)
description: 'When transported into the inner mitochondrial matrix, pyruvate encounters
  two principal metabolizing enzymes: pyruvate carboxylase, PC (a gluconeogenic enzyme)
  and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the first enzyme of the PDH complex (PDHc). With
  a high cell-energy charge, co-enzyme A (CoA) is highly acylated, principally as
  acetyl-CoA, and able to obligately activate pyruvate carboxylase, directing pyruvate
  toward gluconeogenesis. When the energy charge is low, CoA is not acylated, therefore,
  pyruvate carboxylase is inactive, and pyruvate is preferentially metabolized via
  the PDHc and the TCA cycle to CO2 and H2O. The acetyl-CoA produced by the PDHc enters
  the TCA cycle and the reduced electron carriers (NADH and FADH2) that are generated
  during the oxidative reactions can then be used to drive ATP synthesis via oxidative
  phosphorylation. Description source: [https://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/tca-cycle.php

  via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2453 CPTAC Assay Portal].'
