description: This figure presents a comprehensive overview of molecular markers associated
  with neuroinflammation, specifically focusing on potential blood-based markers.
  Markers are organized by biological function and relevance to specific neuroimmune
  processes. The markers are grouped into seven categories, including systemic innate-immune
  mediators; blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and vascular endothelial injury;
  glial activation, which is subdivided into astrocyte and microglial activation;
  neuromodulators and neuropeptides; neuronal injury markers; the neurotoxic metabolite
  quinolinic acid, a neuroactive product of the kynurenine pathway; and neurotrophic
  factors.
