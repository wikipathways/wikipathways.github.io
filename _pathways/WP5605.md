description: The human β-like globin gene cluster is shown together with the five
  DNase-hypersensitive sites of the locus control region (LCR) super-enhancer. The
  LCR regulates developmental expression by sequentially interacting with different
  globin genes during embryonic, fetal, and adult stages. A schematic of the transcription-factor
  complex that promotes LCR looping to the adult globin genes is also included. Genomic
  coordinates correspond to the GRCh38 assembly.  Inspired by figure 1 in [Vasiloudis
  et al. 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12249674/).
