description: This one-carbon metabolism pathway is centered around folate. Folate
  is the primary methyl-group donor for processes such as DNA methylation reactions,
  nucleotide synthesis and DNA repair mechanisms. An important pathway for any study
  related to folate or DNA methylation.  Differential methylation (e.g. hypermethylation
  of tumor suppressors) as well as disturbances in nucleotide synthesis and repair,
  are associated with several forms of cancer. There are also indications that hypermethylation
  is involved in the progression of adenomas to cancer.  Inferred from human one-carbon
  metabolism pathway.
