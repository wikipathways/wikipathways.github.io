description: Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the
  pancreas. When most investigators use the term 'pancreatic cancer' they are referring
  to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Normal duct epithelium progresses to
  infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors, Pancreatic
  Intraepithelial Neoplasia ([PanINs](https://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/professionals/DuctLesions.php)).
  The overexpression of HER-2/neu (ERBB2) and activating point mutations in the K-ras
  gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene (CDKN2A) at an intermediate stage,
  and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras
  engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded
  as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers
  via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows
  extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in
  p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the
  SMAD4 tumor suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming
  growth factor-beta signaling pathway.  The progression of disease and associated
  mutations is defined based on the arrow at the top, from left to right. Phosphorylation
  sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.
