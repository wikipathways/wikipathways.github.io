description: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin essential
  for growth, differentiation, plasticity, and survival of neurons. BDNF is also required
  for processes such as energy metabolism, behavior, mental health, learning, memory,
  stress, pain and apoptosis. BDNF is implicated in various neuronal disorders such
  as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, depression, and bipolar disorder.  BDNF
  binds to tyrosine kinase receptor known as tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB).
  It also binds with low affinity to p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). BDNF and
  its receptors are expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system.  BDNF
  signaling is elicited when it dimerizes and binds to TrkB, resulting in the receptor
  dimerization and autophosphorylation. The activation of the receptor results in
  its interaction with molecules such as Shp2, Shc and PLC-gamma. These molecules
  further interact and modify their downstream targets leading to various neuronal
  processes. BDNF activates the signaling cascades such as PLC/PKC, PI3K/Akt, Ras/Erk,
  AMPK/ACC and NFκB pathways. BDNF through PLC/PKC pathway leads to release of intracellular
  calcium and regulation of synaptic plasticity. It also maintains synaptic plasticity
  through cAMP/PKA signaling. Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway through BDNF/TrkB interaction
  inhibits cell apoptosis by decreasing the expression of BIM. However, BDNF/p75NTR
  interaction activates JNK through TRAF6, which leads to apoptosis. Activation of
  JNK3 also leads to proteolytic cleavage of the p75NTR by TACE. PI3K/Akt also leads
  to activation of mTOR pathway and subsequently protein synthesis. Ras/Erk signaling
  is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and protection of neurons. BDNF
  also leads to neuronal survival through Erk5/Mef pathway. Phosphorylation of synapsin
  by Erk1/2 leads to neurotransmitter release. BDNF signaling leads to nitric oxide
  production through NFκB pathway. BDNF induces neurite outgrowth through activation
  of JAK/STAT, Rac, and Cdc42 pathways. BDNF enhances oxidation of fat through AMPK
  mediated inhibition of ACC. It also plays role in microtubule assembly through inhibition
  of GSK3-beta. It leads to oxidative neuronal necrosis through activation of NCF
  molecules. BDNF also regulates the surface expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors.
  BDNF also regulates the expression of genes leading to processes such as differentiation
  of dendrites and calcification of cementoblast-like cells.
