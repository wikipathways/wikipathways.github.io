description: Cytokinin signaling pathway starts from receiving of the ligand (cytokinin)
  by the cytokinin receptors (a dimer), followed by a phosphate relay by acceptor
  and donor domains of the receptors and then the histidine phosphotransmitters (HPs).
  HPs activate the type-A and type-B Arabidopsis response regulators (ARRs) to initiate
  the downstream events in cytokinin mediated response. Caesar et al (2011) show receptor
  location in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, though all the classical models
  show them on plasma membrane.  Paralogs from the A. thaliana genome for AHKs, AHPs,
  Type-A and Type-B ARRs were added as group members (not as members of complex) on
  the pathway diagram.
