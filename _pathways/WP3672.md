description: LncRNA-mediated mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. Mechanisms of tumor
  cell resistance to chemotherapy or hypoxia involving lncRNA include modulation of
  drug transporters and elimination, survival signaling pathways, cell cycle progression
  and DNA repair, sensitization to apoptosis, and modulation of intercellular communication
  mediated by extracellular vesicles.  This pathway is based on Fig 6 from [Parasramka
  et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27013343).  Proteins on this pathway have
  targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3672).
