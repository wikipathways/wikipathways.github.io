description: 'Like many other amino acids, asparagine may be utilized by S. cerevisiae
  as a sole source of nitrogen. Catabolism of asparagine for nitrogen involves the
  action of asparaginases, which hydrolyze the amide group in the side chain of asparagine.
  This converts asparagine to aspartate and releases an assimilable molecule of ammonia
  (NH₃). Further nitrogen can be derived from the newly generated aspartate molecule
  via its reversible conversion to glutamate by aspartate aminotransferases. Glutamate,
  whose amino group can be hydrolyzed to release ammonia, represents one of the major
  sources of nitrogen for biosynthetic reactions in S. cerevisiae.  SOURCE: [SGD pathways](http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/server.html)'
