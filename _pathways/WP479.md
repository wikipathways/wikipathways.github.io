description: Chorismate, an intermediate in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids
  and the vitamins, p-aminobenzoate and p-hydroxybenzoate, is synthesized by the shikimate
  pathway. The shikimate pathway has been found to be common to all eukaryotes and
  prokaryotes studied thus far (as reported in.  In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the initial
  step is catalyzed by two deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase
  isoenzymes, one of which (ARO3) is feedback inhibited by phenylalanine, and the
  other (ARO4) by tyrosine.  Both DAHP isoenzymes are derepressed by amino acid starvation
  (general control of amino acid biosynthesis). The 5 subsequent reactions are catalyzed
  by the pentafunctional arom enzyme, Aro1p.  Aro1p is a mosaic of five monofunctional
  domains, each of which corresponds to one of five separate monofunctional E. coli
  enzymes.  The last step of chorismate biosynthesis, before the pathway branches
  to synthesize different terminal products, is catalyzed by Aro2p.   Description
  from YeastPathways.
