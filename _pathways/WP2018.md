  title: Hematopoietic stem-cell senescence and myocardial repair - Coronary artery
    disease genotype/phenotype analysis of post-MI myocardial regeneration response
    induced by CABG/CD133+ bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell treatment in RCT PERFECT
    Phase 3 (2020)
description: 'RANKL (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand), RANK (Receptor
  activator of nuclear factor-kappa B) and the natural decoy receptor of RANKL, OPG
  (Osteoprotegerin) are three important molecules identified to play a major role
  in osteoclastogenesis and bone remodelling. They are members of the tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF) superfamily. OPG was the first molecule to be discovered and proved
  to inhibit osteoclastogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Unlike other members of
  TNF family, OPG lack a transmembrane domain and is secreted as a soluble protein
  by the cell. RANKL is the only known physiological agonist for its receptor, RANK.
  Genetic experiments have shown that mice lacking either rankl or rank suffer from
  severe osteoporosis and defective tooth eruption due to complete lack of osteoclasts.
  On the contrary, mice deficient of OPG shows osteoporosis due to increased number
  of osteoclasts. Binding of RANKL to RANK triggers downstream signaling events that
  leads to the activation of osteoclasts and controlling of lineage commitment. RANKL/RANK
  signaling is essential for skeletal homoeostasis and its interference leads to inhibition
  of bone resorption resulting in bone diseases including osteoporosis osteopetrosis
  and rheumatoid arthritis. RANK being a member of TNF family does not possess any
  kinase activity. It recruits adaptor molecules to transduce the signal after ligand
  binding. These adaptor molecules are called TNFR-associated factors or TRAF''s that
  binds to different regions in the cytoplasmic tail of the TNF family receptors and
  transduces the signal downstream. TRAF6 is the main adaptor molecule which activates
  NF-κB pathway downstream of RANKL signaling which is required for osteoclastogenesis
  and osteoclast activation. TRAF6 mutant mice have shown a partial block in osteoclastogenesis
  and defective activation of mature osteoclasts. Mice lacking NF-κB p50 and p52 proteins
  have been shown to be osteopetrotic. Catalytic subunits, IκB kinase α and IκB kinase
  β and the non-catalytic subunit IKKγ (also called NEMO) are also essential for RANKL-RANK
  signaling and osteoclastogenesis. IKKγ is required for osteoclastogenesis induced
  by RANKL in mice both in vivo and in vitro whereas IKKα was shown to be required
  in mice only in in vitro. Several mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK''s) have
  been shown to be activated downstream of RANK. Studies have shown that pharmacological
  inhibition of p38 MAPK''s blocked RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation. JNK1/2,
  its upstream kinase MKK7 and c-Jun have also been shown by genetic experiments to
  be essential for RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis. MAPK1 and MAPK3 phosphorylation
  was also shown to be dispensable for RANKL mediated osteoclast differentiation in
  vitro, but another report also show that specific inhibitors to MEK increased RANKL
  induced osteoclastogenesis suggesting a cross talk between p38 and ERK signaling
  pathways. NFATc1 is an essential downstream target of RANK. Ca2+ oscillations induced
  by RANKL activated NFATc1 resulting in terminal differentiation of osteoclasts through
  the Ca2+- dependent calcineurin pathway. NFATc1 translocates to the nucleus where
  it interacts with other transcription factors leading to the activation of transcription
  of genes including ACP5, CTSK, TNFRSF11A and NFATc1 under RANKL stimulation. TRAF6
  and c-Src interacts with each other and with RANK upon stimulation with RANKL. This
  interaction increases the kinase activity of c-Src leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation
  of downstream molecules such as c-Cbl and activation of Akt/PKB which in turn requires
  the PI3-Kinase activity. Genetic experiments have shown that c-Src is very important
  in osteoclastogenesis. In addition to these pathways, aPKC/p62 signaling is also
  reported to be essential for osteoclastogenesis. Apart from their role in osteoclast
  differentiation and function, RANKL-RANK signaling is also required for development
  of lymph node and lactating mammary glands in mice and in the establishment of thymic
  microenvironment.  Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/rankl_pathway.html
