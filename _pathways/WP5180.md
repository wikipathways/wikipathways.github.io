description: 'DYRK1A (Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A)(OMIM
  600855) is a kinase whose gene is located at 21q22.13 and is highly conserved.It
  is composed of a nuclear targeting sequence, a protein kinase domain, a leucine
  zipper motif and a 13-consecutive-histidine repeat. The gene is located in the so-called
  "Down syndrome critical region" (DSCR), a region on chromosome 21 thought responsible
  for most phenotypic manifestations of Down syndrome. DYRK1A is involved in signaling
  pathways regulating cell proliferation in brain development. Amongst others, haploinsufficiency
  of DYRK1A, DYRK1A overexpression and interactions with alpha-synuclein are thought
  to be the main factors for the clinical phenotype. '
