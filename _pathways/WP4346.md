description: 'This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Sterol lipids expended pathway
  display [https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps] and extended with Scheme 1
  from Acimovic et al (2013 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23558541]). Literature
  suggests that cholesterol synthesis preferentially starts with the Bloch pathway,
  however there is a shift to the Kandutsch-Russell part via lathosterol (Bae et al,
  1997[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9291139]).  Dashed lines indicate that
  multiple steps are involved to create the final product. Several regulatory effects
  concerning the metabolites of cholesterol have been indicated as well. The content
  from the Bloch and Kandutsch-Russel pathways have been checked against literature,
  and differences compared to the original LipidMaps pathway have been coloured turquoise. '
