  display [(1)](https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps) and extended with Scheme
  1 from Acimovic et al (2013 [pubmed:23558541](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23558541)).
  Literature suggests that cholesterol synthesis preferentially starts with the Bloch
  pathway, however there is a shift to the Kandutsch-Russell part via lathosterol
  (Bae et al, 1997 [pubmed:9291139](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9291139)).  Dashed
  lines indicate that multiple steps are involved to create the final product. Several
  regulatory effects concerning the metabolites of cholesterol have been indicated
  as well. The content from the Bloch and Kandutsch-Russel pathways have been checked
  against literature, and differences compared to the original LipidMaps pathway have
  been coloured turquoise. '
