description: Astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle in Homo sapiens. The pathway shows the
  relation between neuronal activity and lactate production in astrocytes. These shuttles
  show how lactate can be broken down by lactate dehydrogenase into pyruvate which
  enters the TCA cycle in neurons.  In astrocytes, glucose undergoes glycolysis to
  be converted into pyruvate, which is then converted into lactate with the help of
  the LDHA enzyme. Lactate is then transported from astrocytes to neurons through
  the transporters SLC16A1, SLC16A3 and SLC16A7. There, lactate is converted to pyruvate
  with the help of the LDHB enzyme. Pyruvate formation is also increased by glucose
  entering the neuron through the SLC2A3 transporter, which undergoes glycolysis.
  Pyruvate enters the TCA cycle in the mitochondria of the neuron and ATP is produced.  The
  ATP generated in the neurons is required for the glutamate neurotransmitters to
  be excreted from neurons into the synaptic cleft. Astrocytes take up the glutamate
  neurotransmitters through the transporter SLC1A2. For glutamate to be transported
  into the cell by the SLC1A2 transporter, Na⁺ must be cotransported into the cell.
  This increase in concentration of sodium ions inside the astrocyte is balanced by
  Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase which transports Na⁺ out of the cell while simultaneously transporting
  K⁺ into the cell. This transporter requires ATP to be activated, and the ADP produced
  can be regenerated into ATP during glycolysis in the astrocytes.  This lactate shuttle
  theory explains that lactate from astrocytes is preferentially used over glucose
  by neurons in a fully aerobic state and is the main supply of energy to our neurological
  system.
