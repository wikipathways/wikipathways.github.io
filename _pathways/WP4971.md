description: Phosphatidylinositols are a family of lipids under the phosphatidylglyceride
  class. This pathway specifies several metabolic conversions between PIP, PIP2, PIP3
  and other metabolites. Phosphorylation sites on the individual metabolites are drawn
  as states, with the location added as a number.  The main interactions within this
  pathway are based on Figure 1 of [https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth867 Rusten et al],
  annotated with biochemical interaction database [https://www.rhea-db.org/ Rhea],
  and diseases (depicted in pink) with corresponding [https://www.omim.org/ OMIM-identifiers.].
  Dashed lines depict proposed interactions which have not been characterised (yet)
