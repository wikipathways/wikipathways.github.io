  title: Clinical improvement of DM1 patients reflected by reversal of disease-induced
    gene expression in blood (2022)
description: The transcription factors involved in adipogenesis are shown in the current
  pathway. Adipogensis is the biological proces of cell differentation in which preadipocytes
  are converted into adipocytes.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available
  via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3599 CPTAC Assay Portal].
