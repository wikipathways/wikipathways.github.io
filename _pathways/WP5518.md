description: Platelets generate TXA2, which binds to its receptor (TP) on T cells,
  initiating the activation of ARHGEF1, a guanine exchange factor that promotes the
  conversion of RhoA from its inactive GDP-bound state to its active GTP-bound form.
  This RhoA activation inhibits TCR-induced kinase pathways, T cell proliferation,
  and effector functions, ultimately suppressing anti-metastatic immunity. TXA2 production
  by platelets is COX1-dependent and can be blocked by aspirin or COX-1 selective
  inhibitors, which relieve T cells from TXA2-mediated suppression.  Inspired by figure
  14 in in [Yang et al. (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08626-7)..
