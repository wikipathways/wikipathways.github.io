description: 'The transcription factor DUX4 is normally expressed during the 4-cell
  stage, activating various pathways leading to cleavage. This pathway shows how the
  abberrant expression of DUX4 in post-embryonic stages leads to several disturbations
  in skeletal muscle fibers, leading to adverse outcomes such as inflammation, apoptosis,
  and other processes contributing to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD).
  Low D4Z4 subunit methylation, which is caused either by low amount of D4Z4 subunits
  combined with a permissive 4q haplotype, or a mutation in genes involved with D4Z4
  methylation, results in the expression of DUX4. '
