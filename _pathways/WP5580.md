description: In decidual NK (dNK) cells, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors
  (KIRs) interact with HLA-C allotypes on extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells to
  modulate immune responses at the maternal–fetal interface. Inhibitory KIRs transmit
  signals through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which recruit
  SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases to suppress activation pathways. Conversely, activating
  KIRs signal via the adaptor protein DAP12, whose ITAM motifs recruit SYK kinase,
  leading to downstream activation of LAT, SLP-76, VAV1, PLC-γ1, and NF-κB. This cascade
  promotes cytokine production and functional activation of dNK cells. Additionally,
  KIR signaling has been linked to repeated pregnancy loss (RPL), suggesting coordination
  between immune signaling and placental development mediated by dNK cells. The exact
  origin of dNK cells (phenotype CD56⁺⁺ (bright) CD16⁻) is still uncertain. Some studies
  suggest they may arise from CD34⁺ progenitor cells, while others propose that peripheral
  blood NK (pbNK) cells or local NK precursors give rise to uterine NK (uNK) cells.
  These uNK cells may then differentiate into either endometrial NK (eNK) cells, which
  are present before pregnancy, or decidual NK (dNK) cells, which appear during early
  pregnancy.
