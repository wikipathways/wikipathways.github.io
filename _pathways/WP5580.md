description: In decidual NK (dNK) cells, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors
  (KIRs) interact with HLA-C allotypes on extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells to
  modulate immune responses at the maternal–fetal interface. Inhibitory KIRs transmit
  signals through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which recruit
  SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases to suppress activation pathways. Conversely, activating
  KIRs signal via the adaptor protein DAP12, whose ITAM motifs recruit SYK kinase,
  leading to downstream activation of LAT, SLP-76, VAV1, PLC-γ1, and NF-κB. This cascade
  promotes cytokine production and functional activation of dNK cells.  Additionally,
  KIR signaling has been linked to ribosomal protein-linked (RPL) pathways, suggesting
  coordination between immune signaling and translational regulation in dNK-mediated
  placental development.
