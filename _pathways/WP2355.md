description: 'Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide secreted abundantly
  in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebral cortex and
  cerebellum in the central nervous system. It is also expressed in adrenal gland,
  placenta, testis, spleen, gut, thymus and skin. CRH is the principal mediator of
  endocrine stress response. CRH also plays a significant role in inflammatory responses,
  hemodynamic actions, stromal cell decidualization during estrus cycle, implantation
  of blastocyst, maintenance of pregnancy, onset of labor  and neuroprotection. Excess
  secretion of CRH during severe depression and its association with increased levels
  of cortisol have been observed. CRH has also been reported to be involved in anxiety
  disorders, anorexia nervosa. Decrease in cortical CRH content has been observed
  in Alzheimer''s disease  and Parkinson''s disease.  The actions of CRH are mediated
  through class II/secretin-like family type of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)
  called the CRH receptors (CRHR). CRH is a high affinity ligand of CRHR1 and also
  binds to CRHR2 but with lower affinity. CRH receptors do not have any intrinsic
  kinase activity and transduce the signal via the heterotrimeric G-proteins. The
  CRH receptors are rapidly desensitized by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)
  and Î²-arrestin mechanisms in the presence of high concentrations of CRH. Binding
  of CRH to CRH receptor induces a conformational change in the receptor by activating
  it. This further activates GÎ±-subunit and its subsequent dissociation from the
  GÎ²Î³ dimer. CRH receptors on interaction with GÎ±-subunit of different G-proteins
  such as GÎ±s, GÎ±i/o, GÎ±q/11 activate numerous downstream signaling cascades and
  result in the induction of various cellular responses. The pathways that are activated
  upon CRH stimulation are: Adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA, PLC/PKC, ERK/MAPK, PI3K-AKT
  and NF-kappa B.   CRH binding to CRHR1 couples G-stimulatory (Gs) protein which
  in turn activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Activation of PKA leads to
  the phosphorylation of transcription factors like cAMP response element binding
  protein (CREB), which in turn increases the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)
  gene and the release of POMC-derived peptides, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
  and Î²-endorphin. ACTH, in turn, stimulates the secretion of glucocorticoids from
  adrenal glands and thereby mediates changes associated with stress response. CREB
  also regulates genes containing the Ca2+/cAMP response element such as FOS. The
  activation of cAMP by CRH induces the mRNA expression and transcription of orphan
  nuclear receptors NR4A1 and NR4A2, which in turn transcriptionally activates the
  expression of POMC. Activation of cAMP/PKA can also induce the expression of enzymes
  involved in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol production. The biological
  functions of CRH are also mediated by MAPK family, in particular MAPK1/3 and MAPK14.
  MAPK1/3 mediates activation of transcription factors NR4A1 and NR4A2 and induction
  of POMC in corticotrophs. MAPK14 is involved in CRH-induced inhibition of IL-18
  expression in human keratinocytes. The CRHR1/PKA/ERK signaling activate the transcription
  factors - ELK1, SP1 and TFAP2A. SP1 and TFAP2A up-regulates the expression of ADRBK2,
  which causes the desensitization of CRHR1 receptors.  The PLC/PKC pathway is activated
  by coupling of the CRH receptors to the GÎ±q/11 proteins. This cascade stimulates
  the formation of IP3 and contributes to the mobilization of intracellular calcium.
  Calcium is involved in the transcription regulation of FOS as well as NR4A1 and
  NR4A2 through CAMK2A. PLC/PKC is involved in the activation of AP-1 complex and
  subsequent transcriptional regulation of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation
  and proliferation â€“ KRT1, KRT14 and IVL. This cascade also inhibits the expression
  of CYP11A1 and HSD3B1, the genes involved in progesterone synthesis in placental
  trophoblasts.  Another important signaling pathway activated upon CRH stimulation
  is the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP, involved in the control of vascular tone. In human
  keratinocytes, upon CRH stimulation, NFKBIA degradation is diminished and the activity
  of NFKB is inhibited resulting in the down-regulation of NFKB-dependent genes IL2
  and HSP90AA1 and inhibition of cell proliferation. The gene involved in cell survival,
  BCL2 is transcriptionally regulated via the PI3K/AKT.  Please access this pathway
  at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/CRH_pathway.html) database.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2355)'
