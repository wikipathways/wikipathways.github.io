description: PDGF belongs to the PDGF/VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) family,
  which is characterized by eight strictly conserved cysteine residues with similar
  spacing in between (Joukov et al., 1997; Heldin and Westermark, 1999). The A-, B-,
  C-, and D-chain genes of PDGF are localized to the chromosomes 7p22, 22q13, 4q31,
  and 11q22, respectively, and their expression is independently regulated. Two forms
  of the PDGF A-chain, containing 196 and 211 amino acid residues resulting from differential
  splicing of the transcript, are synthesized, dimerized, proteolytically processed
  in the Nterminus, and secreted from the cell as a ~30 kDa dimer. The PDGF B chain
  encoding 241 amino acid residues is dimerized, processed by additional proteolysis,
  and secreted as a 24 kDa dimer. The homodimers PDGF AA, BB, and the heterodimer
  AB contain three intrachain disulfide bonds made between the 1st.   Proteins on
  this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2526
