description: 'The biosynthesis of aspartate is an interface between amino acid metabolism
  and carbohydrate metabolism. Aspartate is synthesized through a transamination reaction
  between oxaloacetate, an important Krebs cycle intermediate, and glutamate, an amino
  acid. Here, aspartate aminotransferase catalyzes the reversible transfer of an amino
  group from glutamate to oxaloacetate, forming -ketoglutarate and aspartate. Yeast
  aspartate aminotransferase is encoded by AAT1 and AAT2. Aat1p localizes to mitochondria
  and may be involved in a putative malate-aspartate shuttle, while Aat2p localizes
  to the cytosol and is required for growth on minimal media lacking aspartate. Aspartate,
  in addition to its role as a proteinogenic amino acid, is a substrate in the arginine
  biosynthesis pathway and a precursor to the aspartate family amino acids methionine,
  isoleucine, asparagine, and threonine in S. cerevisiae.  Source: [YeastGenome](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/).'
