description: 'The uppermost part of the pathway includes part of the general NAM salvage
  pathway in the cytosol as it is relevant to senescence-induced changes to NAD metabolism.
  In this pathway, NAD levels are maintained through recycling back to NAD from nicotinamide
  (NAM) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (Braidy et al., 2019). The conversion
  from NAM to NMN is catalyzed by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT),
  while the conversion from NMN to NAD is catalyzed by nicotinamide mononucleotide
  adenylyl transferases (NMNATs). Other sources, such as nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamid
  riboside (NR), are not shown here as they are not affected by senescence, at least
  from current research. OIS-specific interactions are highlighted in orange, while
  MiDAS-specific interactions are highlighted in purple. General interactions for
  both (or other senescent types) remain a black color.  The OIS pathway, induced
  by Ras singalling in this case, results in the upregulation of HMGA1, and stimulation
  of the NAMPT enzyme (Nacarelli et al., 2019). Resulting increased levels of NMN
  (the direct metabolite of NAMPT) translate to increased NAD levels, and a high NAD-NADH
  ratio. This leads to decreased ADP-ATP levels, which causes a decreased phosphorylated
  AMPK expression (Nacarelli et al., 2019). This interaction causes increased p38
  and p65 activation, and increased NF-κB activity. The  NF-κB signalling pathway
  has been known to play a key role in the promotion of the proinflammatory SASP (Freund
  et al., 2011). Furthermore, this is correlated with increased expression of interleukins
  IL1B, IL6 and IL8, all key factors in the proinflammatory wave of the SASP. In addition,
  Nacarelli et al. (2019) found that the proinflammatory environment created as a
  result of the increased NAD-NADH ratio leads to acceleration of cancer progression.
  NAMPT upregulation through HMGA1 also resulted in the expression of senescence markers
  SA-ß-gal, p16 and p21. The resulting phenotype from this high NAD-NADH ratio is
  a high proinflammatory SASP.    Malate is another important metabolite in redox
  reactions and in many senescence types, including OIS and MiDAS. Of interest to
  NAD metabolism is the malate-aspartate shuttle, where NADH is transferred from the
  cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix through malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1) (Lee et
  al., 2012). In senescence, levels of MDH1 decrease. On the other hand, decreased
  activity of MDH1 can induce a senescence response. This reduction in MDH1 activity
  results in a decreased cytosolic NAD-NADH. Lastly, this inhibition may result in
  loss of cell proliferation due to the requirement of aspartate synthesis in response
  to inhibition of the electron transport chain (Birsoy et al., 2015).  Mitochondrial
  dysfunction-associated senescence (MiDAS), on the other hand, causes a decrease
  in the NAD-NADH ratio, which induces three main responses: (1) the inhibition of
  sirtuins, (2) the activation of AMPK and (3) the inhibition of PARP which blocks
  the NF-kB pathway. First, low levels of NAD+ decrease sirtuin activity. A decrease
  in the activity of SIRT3 and  SIRT5, located in the mitochondria, is associated
  with the activation of cell senescence (Wiley et al., 2016)). Second, a decreased
  NAD+/NADH ratio activates AMPK and p53, which inhibits the RNA binding protein Hu
  antigen R (HuR) from degrading the mRNAs encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors,
  p21 and p16INK4a. This increases the activity of the pRB tumor suppressor, resulting
  in cell proliferation and growth arrest ((Wiley et al., 2016)). Additionally, p53
  activation leads to the release of SASPs that lack IL-1-dependent factors but include
  the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and high levels of the pro-inflammatory
  cytokines CCL27 and TNF-α (Wiley et al., 2016). The activation of p53 also reduces
  glycolysis and promotes mitochondrial respiration, by inhibiting phosphoglycercate
  mutase (PGM) and inducing the expression of synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2
  (SCO2). Furthermore, p53 activation inhibits the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  by binding to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Lastly, the low NAD+,NADH
  ratio inhibits ADP-ribose donor for poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), which consecutively
  inhibits the NF-kB pathway. A downregulated NF-κB pathway then contributes to the
  pathogenic processes of various inflammatory diseases as well as the expression
  of various proinflammatory SASPs (Liu et al., 2017).   As visible in this pathway,
  when senescence is induced by either OIS or MiDAS distinguishable effects on NAD
  metabolism are evident. Not only do these stimuli release distinct SASPs, but they
  exhibit distinct responses on the NAD-NADH ratio and subsequent related pathways.
  While MiDAS leads to a decrease in the NAD-NADH ratio, OIS causes an increase in
  this ratio and the NAD+ levels.'
