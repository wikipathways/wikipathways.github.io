description: 'Simplified PDGFR-beta pathway, based on figure 7B from [Zhang et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27372738).   Platelet-derived
  growth factor receptors (PDGFR) are cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors for members
  of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family. PDGF subunits -A and -B are
  important factors regulating cell proliferation, cellular differentiation, cell
  growth, development and many diseases including cancer. There are two forms of the
  PDGFR, alpha and beta each encoded by a different gene. Depending on which growth
  factor is bound, PDGFR homo- or heterodimerizes.  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet-derived_growth_factor_receptor)
  Protein phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus
  (R), www.phosphosite.org.'
