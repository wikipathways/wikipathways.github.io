description: 'Laminopathies resulting form a range of LMNA mutations result in a range
  of tissue specific phenotypes. These rare diseases may be attributed to a symptomatic
  overlap characterized by the convergence of lamin A downstream signaling pathways.
  Lamin A is expressed in differentiating cells and thus this pathway highlights the
  major molecular signaling pathways misregulated during hMSC differentiation due
  to varying LMNA mutations. '
