  title: Reprogramming of glucocorticoid receptor function by hypoxia (2021)
description: Reaction scheme of the proposed gene regulatory network (GRN).  The scheme
  details the full GRN for one cell and part of a neighboring cell for those reactions
  that involve ligand-receptor interactions like in Delta-Notch signaling or input
  from the Fgf8 or Wnt3a signal transduction pathways. Color-coded circular areas
  for each gene symbolize mRNA and protein. For fast changing gene products the transport
  of mRNA or protein between cytoplasm and nucleus or between cytoplasm and membrane
  is explicitly simulated, which is indicated by dividing each half-area of the circle
  again. Regulatory interactions are shown as activating or repressing arrows. Broken
  lines indicate that the interaction is simulated only in an even more course-grained
  manner than the other gene regulatory reactions. NICD, which originates through
  cleavage reactions following DLL1 ligand binding to the NOTCH1 receptor, was assigned
  a separate symbol to clarify that only the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor
  acts in the nucleus as a transcription (co)-factor. The (weak) modulating action
  of LFNG on D/N signaling is shown as dashed lines - (red for the case of inhibiting
  action, green for the case of a positive effect on the D/N reaction rate.) Arrows
  pointing to the symbol for the empty set designate decay reactions of a species.
  We suppressed them for all species' decays except for those decay rates that we
  assume as controlled by signal transduction pathways. This applies also to the removal
  of DLL1 and NOTCH1 from the membrane after their binding, resulting in NOTCH1 cleavage
  and NICD split-off.
