description: 'Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a highly pleiotropic, autosomal recessive
  disease that leads to multisystem defects and has an intricate cellular phenotype,
  all linked to the functional inactivation of a single gene. Extensive research on
  the phenotype and the recent discovery and cloning of the responsible gene point
  to a defect as a central biochemical locus which links several signal transduction
  pathways that operate under stress as well as in normal physiological conditions.  Ataxia
  is the first symptom in all patients and is predominantly truncal, first manifested
  in swaying of the head and trunk on standing and even sitting. Truncal ataxia precedes
  appendicular cerebellar disease. In the first years of life, certain manifestations
  are present such as dysarthria, muscular hypotonia, the slow initiation and performance
  of all voluntary movements, characteristic hypotonic facies and postures, and drooling.
  Dyssynergia and intention tremor of the upper extremities become a major feature
  after the fifth year of life. The tendon reflexes are diminished or lost, but may
  be normal or even hyperactive in the early stages. All these observations show a
  clear ataxia of cerebellar type, initially of station and gait, and later of intention.
  Early observations of brains from patients with A-T showed neurodegenerative changes,
  particularly in the Purkinje and granular cells of the cerebellum. Neuronal degeneration
  is also present in the brainstem, and dentate and olivary nuclei atrophy. Neuronal
  loss occurs in the substantial nigra and oculomotor nuclei, dorsal root ganglia,
  and degenerative changes are evident in spinal motor neurons, and dorsal root and
  sympathetic motor neurons. Moreover, multiple abnormalities in Purkinje cell development
  have been observed in an Atm-deficient mouse model. Misplaced Purkinje cells have
  been observed in both the granular and molecular cell layers. In addition, Purkinje
  cell dendrites tend to grow laterally instead of extending towards the surface of
  the cerebellum.  ATM (for Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) has been located by restriction-fragment
  length polymorphism in the chromosome 11, location: 108,093,211-108,239,829. Interestingly,
  the site of ATM is the same or adjacent to the region occupied by CD3 (Antigen,
  Delta subunit), THY1 (T-Cell antigen), and NCAM (Cell Adhesion Molecule, Neural,
  1) genes, all of which are members of the immunoglobulin-gene superfamily and consequently
  may be subject to the same defect that afflicts the T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin
  molecules in A-T. The ATM gene presents an open reading frame (ORF) of 9,165 kb
  cDNA and is constituted by 66 exons spread over 150 kb of genomic DNA which has
  a transcript of 12 kb. The ORF of this transcript predicts a 370-kDa protein composed
  of 3056 amino acids. Over 300 mutations have been found in A-T patients, distributed
  across the full length (150 kb of genomic DNA) of the ATM gene.  Sequence homology
  indicates that the atm gene product falls into a family of proteins that are related
  to the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). This family
  includes TEL1, MEC1, TOR1, and TOR2 of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
  RAD3 of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and MEI-41 of Drosophila melanogaster.
  The mammalian family member most closely related to ATM is the ATR/FRP1 protein
  and, like its yeast homologs, it mediates cellular responses to unreplicated or
  damaged DNA. In humans the PI 3-kinase family includes the catalytic subunit of
  the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) and FRAP. These sequence homologies
  appear to reflect functional homology because many of the PI 3-kinase family members
  are involved in DNA repair, recombination and cell cycle control. Despite the resemblance
  to lipid kinases, members of this family, including ATM, possess a serine/threonine
  protein kinase activity, which is wortmannin sensitive.  ATM phosphoprotein is ubiquitously
  expressed and predominantly found in nuclei of proliferating cells, but subcellular
  fractionation and immunofluorescence revealed that 10-20% of the protein is present
  in cytoplasmic vesicles, including peroxisomes and endosomes and a prominent cytoplasmic
  fraction in mouse oocytes. ATM is endosome-bound in mouse neurons, suggesting molecular
  sorting of the protein occurs in the cytoplasm. In Purkinje cells, distribution
  of ATM protein is primarily in cytoplasm, and this may be related to the differentiation
  state of the cells. ATM mRNA is present in all human and mouse tissues. In situ
  hybridization shows that ATM mRNA is expressed throughout the whole mouse embryo.
  Furthermore, ATM has been associated with beta-adaptin in lymphoblast vesicles indicating
  that it may play a role in intracellular vesicle and/or protein transport mechanisms.
  No obvious nuclear localization signals have been detected in ATM. Neither an ectopically
  expressed N-terminal fragment of the protein nor a C-terminal fragment is capable
  of entering the nucleus.'
