description: 'This one-carbon metabolism pathway is centered around folate. Folate
  has two key carbon-carbon double bonds. Saturating one of them yields dihydrofolate
  (DHF) and adding an additional molecule of hydrogen across the second yields tetrahydrofolate
  (THF). Folates serve as donors of single carbons in any one of three oxidation states:
  5-methyl-THF (CH3THF; reduced), 5,10 methylene-THF (CH2THF; intermediate) and 10-formyl-THF
  (CHOTHF; oxidized). The single carbon donor CH3THF is used to convert homocysteine
  into methionine which can then be used to methylate DNA, the donor CH2THF is used
  (along with a molecule of hydrogen at the site of one of the double bonds) to convert
  dUMP (deoxyuridylate) into dTMP (thymidylate) and the donor CHOTHF is used to set
  up ring closure reactions in de novo purine synthesis. CH3THF is the primary methyl-group
  donor for processes such as DNA methylation reactions. Purines are used both in
  RNA synthesis and in DNA synthesis and dTMP is synthesized srtictly for DNA synthesis,
  be it for DNA repair or DNA replication. The folate pathway is central to any study
  related to DNA methylation, dTMP synthesis or purine synthesis.  Differential methylation
  (e.g. hypermethylation of tumor suppressors) as well as disturbances in nucleotide
  synthesis and repair, are associated with several forms of cancer. There are also
  indications that hypermethylation is involved in the progression of adenomas to
  cancer.'
