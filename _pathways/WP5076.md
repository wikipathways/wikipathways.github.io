description: ACE2 is a regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. To perform this
  function, ACE2 is transported to the cell surface, where it is cleaved by disintegrin
  and ADAM17 to produce an enzymatically active soluble form of ACE2. This soluble
  form retains the SARS-CoV-2 binding site. SARS-CoV-2 bound to either soluble ACE2
  or soluble ACE2 and vasopressin then uses receptor-mediated endocytosis by through
  either AT1 or AVPR1B, respectively.   This figure is based on the graphical abstract
  from [https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00283-X Yeung et al.].
