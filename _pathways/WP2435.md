description: Quercetin is a flavonoid that is widely distributed in nature. In this
  pathway, its dual nature is depicted. On the one hand, it is capable of exerting
  anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the PLA2-induced conversion
  of cell membrane phospholipids to arachidonic acid, reducing the downstream synthesis
  of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins; furthermore, inhibition of NF-kB and AP-1 transcription
  factor activation also contribute to these effects.  On the other hand, quercetin
  itself may - paraxodically - generate ROS, as well as facilitate the activation
  of NFE2L2, which results in the production of CYP2A6. This isotype of CYP450 was
  found to be involved in the formation of carcinogenic metabolites. Both of these
  effects culminate in DNA damage.  It has been observed, however, that these pro-oxidant
  effects are dominant at higher concentrations, whereas anti-oxidant effects are
  dominant at lower concentrations. Based on this, it has been suggested that quercetin
  may have a scavenging effect.
