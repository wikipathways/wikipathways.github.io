description: C4 carbon fixation is the CO2 fixation mechanism used by the maize plant
  which harbors a kranz anatomy in its leaves. In maize it is carried out in two types
  of cells namely the mesophyll cell where Carbonic anhydrase fixes diffused CO2 to
  HCO3 and the enzyme PEP carboxylase converts HCO3 into oxaloacetic acid. Malate
  dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetic acid into malate in the mesophyll
  chloroplast. Malate is transported to the bundle sheath cell cytoplasm followed
  by the bundle sheath chloroplast where it is broken down into pyruvate and the CO2.
  This CO2 molecule is now fixed into 3-phosphoglycerate molecule by the active Rubisco
  enzyme. This process is different from the C3-carbon assimilation in rice which
  occurs only in the bundle sheath cells.
