description: 'Overview of synthesis of components for myelin sheath of the CNS in
  oligodendrocytes. "Multi-potent neural stem cells are specified into oligodendrocyte
  progenitor cells. OPCs can differentiate into multiple cell types including astrocytes,
  neurons, and Schwann cells. Differentiation along the oligodendroglial lineage to
  pre-oligodendrocytes/immature oligodendrocytes is potentiated by the growth factor
  IGF-1, the cytokine CNTF, and the thyroid hormone T3, and requires several transcription
  factors. BMPs can inhibit this step, as well as the previous one. Differentiation
  into mature oligodendrocytes is associated with acquisition of myelin-related proteins."
  Rephrased from [Miron et al, 2011, Figure 1C+D]. '
