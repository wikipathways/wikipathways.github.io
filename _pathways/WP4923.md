description: 'Autophagy is a process by which cells degrade intracellular components,
  including organelles, proteins, and foreign bodies. Autophagy is inhibited by mTORC1
  and activated by AMPK. The process requires four steps: initiation, formation, membrane
  expansion, and maturation.  These steps are characterized by the structures that
  are roughly represented by the depicted structures: the omegasome, phagophore, autophagosome
  and autolysosome. It requires formation of the autophagosome, a double-membrane
  structure filled with the isolated cytoplasmic material that the cell is removing.
  The autophagosome eventually fuses with the lysosome to form the autolysosome.'
