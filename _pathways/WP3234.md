description: Metabolism of xenobiotic compounds consists of phase I and a phase II
  biotransformation reactions, being compound modification and conjugation reactions
  respectively. In phase I biotransformation, the compound is modificated via oxidation,
  reduction, hydrolysis, or other minor reactions, to reveal a reactive group to which
  a conjugation molecule can react to. In phase II, a small conjugation molecule reacts
  with the phase I modified molecule, producing a much more water-soluble molecule
  that can be excreted more easily. Sulfation is a phase II biotransformation reaction
  in which sulfate acts as a conjugation molecule and binds to a substrate via the
  catalysis of sulfotransferases. Sulfate is first combined with ATP molecules to
  form PAPS via the dual function enzymes PAPSS1 and PAPSS2 consisting of a sulfurylase
  domain and an APS kinase domain. From PAPS the sulfate group is transferred to the
  actual substrate via the action of sulfotransferases, resulting in a sulfated substrate
  and the sulfate-lacking PAP.
