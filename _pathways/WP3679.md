  title: Identification of the shared gene signatures and pathways between sarcopenia
    and type 2 diabetes mellitus (2022)
description: This pathway is based on Figure 7 of "Cell-Type Specific CCK2 Receptor
  Signaling Underlies the Cholecystokinin-Mediated Selective Excitation of Hippocampal
  Parvalbumin-Positive Fast-Spiking Basket Cells."(See Bibliography).The neuropeptide
  cholecystokinin (CCK) acts through its receptor CCK2R to achieve largely different
  functions in different types of cells. CCK, CCK2R, and CB1R have all been known
  to have substantial effects on anxiety and other mood disorders, and the PV+ interneurons
  have also been shown to be involved i na variety of cognitive functions. However,  In
  PV+ basket cells and CCK+ basket cells, the CCK2 receptor uses different pathways
  to exert different effects on the two types of basket cells. For CCK+ basket cells,
  CCK2 receptors in neighboring pyramidal cells act through the Gq pathway to form
  endocannabinoids, which, through the cannabinoid receptor type 1 on the CCK+ basket
  cell, inhibit the release of the neurotransmitter GABA. In contrast, for PV+ basket
  cells, CCK2 receptors act through the pertussin-toxin sensitive Gi pathway to regulate
  the intracellular Ca2+ through ryanodine receptors. This pathway ultimately leads
  to activation of a non-selective cationic conductance to depolarize the PV+ basket
  cells.
