description: This is pathway is an illustration for pathanatos. Parthanatos is a cell
  death signaling pathway in which excessive oxidative damage to DNA leads to over-activation
  of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP then generates the formation of large
  poly(ADP-ribose) polymers that induce the release of apoptosis-inducing factor from
  the outer mitochondrial membrane.
