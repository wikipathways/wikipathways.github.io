description: This transport pathway shows several tissue specific fatty acid transport
  proteins (FATP), which facilitate fatty acid uptake. The extracellular fatty acids
  can either bind to CD36 or bind directly to the fatty acid transporters. When the
  fatty acids have entered the cell, they can either be coupled to Acyl-CoA by long-chain
  fatty acyl-CoA synthetases or bind to fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs). This
  binding of the fatty acids to CoA or FABPs prevents the efflux of the fatty acids.
