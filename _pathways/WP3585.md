  title: Rett syndrome – biological pathways leading from MECP2 to disorder phenotypes
    (2016)
description: DNA, namely cytosine, methylation is the key event in epigentics. The
  degree of methylation influences gene expression and methylation disorders are known
  to be major causes of some diseases like Rett syndrome and some cancer types. Epigenetic
  effects also contribute to the development of Alzheimers' disease, developmental
  retardation by alcohol, Huntington's disease and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Methylation
  is not a static event but a highly dynamic and therefore highly regulated procedure.
  Cytosine is methylated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) forming 5-methylcytosine
  (5mC). In a second step, 5mC is transformed to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by
  ten-eleven-translocation enzymes (TET1-3). These enzymes are sensitive to regulation
  by a variety of metabolites (ethanol, a-ketoglutarate, 2-hydroxyglutarate), miRNA
  and MeCP2 (targeting directly TET1). Proteins binding methylated DNA like MeCP2
  or Mbd3 (as part of the NURD complex) also inhibit the conversion by blocking the
  target. MeCP2 also binds on 5hmC and block the transition to 5-formylcytosine (5fC)
  which is also catalyzed by the TET enzymes. The conversion back to cytosine is done
  by tymine DNA glycosylase (TGD) and base excision repair mechanism either directly
  or over another TET catalyzed step forming 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC).
