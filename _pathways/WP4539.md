description: Changes in mTOR activation are believed to be a risk factor for ASD.
  mTOR is regulated by the TCS1/2 complex, and several signaling pathways upstream
  of TSC1/2 positively or negatively regulate this complex, including PI3K-AKT, Ras–ERK,
  LKB1–AMPK and Wnt–GSK3β pathways. The mTOR pathway is also regulated by brain‐derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays a key role in the development and the plasticity
  of the central nervous system and is considered a risk factor for ASD. Increased
  levels of BDNF concentration have been observed in the serum and brain of patients
  with ASD.  mTOR is a key modulator of protein synthesis and thus blocks the activation
  of cell autophagy and promotes cell proliferation, growth, and differentiation.
  Proteasome activity is also affected by neuronal activity, via increased expression
  of UBE3A through transcription factor MEF2, which leads to the internalization of
  AMPA-R.  Variations in the calcium channel CACNA1C are also associated with ASD
  and [Timothy syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_syndrome).  Adapted
  from figure 1 in [Daghsni et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6085908/).
