description: 'Xenobiotic compounds containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) or an
  aromatic hydroxylamine (-NHOH) group can be substrates for amino acid conjugation.
  (Source: http://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-156587) Amino acid conjugation
  is important in the biotransformation of several xenobiotic carboxylic acids. An
  amide or peptide bond can be formed between the carboxyl group of the xenobiotic
  and the amino group of an amino acid, mainly glycine, taurine or glutamine. (Source:

  acid conjugation; 1990).'
