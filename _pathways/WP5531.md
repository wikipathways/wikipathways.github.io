description: There are only a few conflicting findings regarding the regulation of
  ARTD family members by AKT signaling. In one type of astrocyte, seizure induction
  increased both PARP1 levels and enzymatic activity, whereas in another type, seizures
  resulted in a decrease in PARP1 and its activity. In both scenarios, inhibiting
  AKT signaling reduced PARP1 protein levels and activity. This suggests that AKT
  may play a role in promoting PARP1 expression and signaling.  Inspired by figure
  5 in [Boehi et al. (2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8560908/#Sec22).
