description: 'This pathway is modeled after Figure 1 in the article " ATR signalling:
  more than meeting at the fork" (See Bibliography). This pathway details the ATR
  signaling which commences when there is a gap in the single strand DNA. It details
  the usage of several independent checkpoint proteins which then cause TOPBP1 dependent
  activation of the phosphorylation and kinase of a large number of substrates including
  CHK1 to commence regulation of cellular response to DNA damage and replication stress.   Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3875)'
