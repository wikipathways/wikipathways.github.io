description: Hematopoietic Stem Cells found in bone marrow can differentiate into
  Monocytes and Erythrocytes, or in the case of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), they
  can continue to proliferate, undifferentiated, in blood. CML is caused by the Philadelphia
  translocation (Ph), which puts ABL behind BCR. The BRC-ABL fusion is a constitutively
  on tyrosine kinase that indirectly counteracts erythroid differentiation, thus promoting
  the continued proliferation underlying CML. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor
  that binds ABL and in turn promotes healthy erythroid differentiation by counteracting
  BRC-ABL activity. Imatinib resistance can be conferred by the over-expression of
  ABC drug transporters and competitive binding kinases.   The pathway diagram above
  aligns molecules with the cell fates they promote, to help keep track of inhibition-of-inhibition-of-inhibition
  sequences, for example. The known mechanisms of imatinib resistance are at the bottom,
  under CML cell fate and are shown interacting with imatinib, which is under the
  erythrocyte cell fate.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available
  via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3640).
