description: 'Glycine is degraded via three pathways. The predominant pathway in animals
  and plants is the reverse of the glycine synthase pathway. In this context, the
  enzyme system involved is usually called the glycine cleavage system. In the second
  pathway, glycine is degraded in two steps. The first step is the reverse of glycine
  biosynthesis from serine with serine hydroxymethyl transferase. Serine is then converted
  to pyruvate by serine dehydratase. In the third pathway of glycine degradation,
  glycine is converted to glyoxylate by D-amino acid oxidase. Glyoxylate is then oxidized
  by hepatic lactate dehydrogenase to oxalate in an NAD+-dependent reaction. Description
