description: 'Leptin is a peptide hormone mainly synthesised and secreted from adipocytes.
  It is also expressed in other tissues including placenta, stomach and skeletal muscle.
  Leptin mediates its effects by binding to its receptor, leptin receptor (LEPR).
  LEPR belongs to gp130 family of cytokine receptor. LEPR is expressed in many tissues
  such as brain, adipose tissue, heart, placenta, lung and liver. Alternative splicing
  of LEPR results in six different isoforms, LEPRa, LEPRb, LEPRc, LEPRd, LEPRe and
  LEPRf. LEPRb is the longest isoform and possess signaling capacity. The role of
  other isoforms in leptin signaling is not clear. Leptin plays a major role in the
  regulation of energy homeostasis and regulate food intake and energy expenditure.
  Leptin is found to be transported to various regions of the brain across blood brain
  barrier. Impairment in leptin signaling across the blood brain barrier induces leptin
  resistance and thus obesity. Leptin is known to regulate reproduction, bone homeostasis
  and immune signaling. Leptin is also implicated in various physiological processers
  such as angiogenesis and hematopoiesis. LEPRb forms a homodimer and binds to leptin
  in 1:1 stoichiometry. This tetrameric receptor/ ligand complex appears to be essential
  for signaling. Leptin receptor lacks intrinsic kinase activity. It mediates multiple
  signaling pathways by binding to cytoplasmic kinases such as Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2).
  Activation of JAK2 by leptin promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of LEPRb at Tyr-986,
  Try-1078 and Tyr-1141, thus activating LEPRb. Activation of leptin receptor with
  leptin activates signaling modules such as JAK/STAT, RAS/RAF/MAPK, IRS1/PI-3K, PLCγ
  and AMPK/ACC modules. Tyrosine phosphorylation of LEPRb induces binding of STATs
  to LEPRb. Binding of STATs to the phosphorylated residues of LEPR leads to the JAK2
  mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STATs. Activated STATs translocate
  to the nucleus and induces expression of genes such as suppressor of cytokine signaling
  3 (SOCS3) and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1). SOCS3 mediates feedback
  inhibition of leptin pathway by binding to Tyr-986 residue of LEPR. Cytosolic PTP1B
  also negatively regulates leptin pathway by dephosphorylating JAK2 and STAT3. Binding
  of leptin to its receptor results in the phosphorylation of PTPN1. Phosphorylated
  PTPN11 provides a docking site for GRB2, resulting in the activation of ERK module
  through RAS-RAF-MEK signaling. Leptin induces the activation of PI-3K by promoting
  the interaction and formation of SH2B/JAK2/IRS complex. Activation PI-3K mediates
  the activation of activation of protein kinases such as protein kinase B (AKT1)
  and downstream signaling cascades such as mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR),
  nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and phosphodiesterase 3A, cGMP-inhibited (PDE3A).
  Activated AKT also regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha/beta (GSK3A/B) proteins.
  IkappaB kinases (IKKs) are activated in response to AKT activation. Activated IKKs
  induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Leptin also regulates 5''-AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. AMPK function as energy sensor and is activated
  in response to rise in AMP to ATP ratio. Activated AMPK regulate fatty acid biosymthesis
  by regulating the activity the enzyme, fatty acid biosynthesis-acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (ACC). PLC gamma is activated in response to leptin signaling. Activated PLC gamma
  regulate intracellular calcium levels and also protein kinase C activation by hydrolysing
  phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).  Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/Leptin_pathway.html
