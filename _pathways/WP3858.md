description: 'TLR and NFkB are important in inflammation in the body and in the cancerous
  cells. TLR signaling pathways are usually connected with MyD88 dependent pathways
  and MyD88 independent pathways. TLR pathways that involve MyD88 dependent pathways
  such as this one involve IRAK complexes. The finding of TLR or NFkB genes within
  the body usually correlates with breast cancer within the person.  This pathway
  is based on the figure 1 of "Genetic variation in TLR or NFkappaB pathways and the
  risk of breast cancer: a case-control study" (see bibliography).  Proteins on this
  pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3858).'
