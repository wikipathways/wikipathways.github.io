description: The integrin alpha6beta4 was discovered in the late 1980s by two different
  groups and was called either alphaEbeta4 or Ic-Ic binding protein (Ic-IcBP) (1,2).
  The alpha6beta4 integrin is a component of Hemidesmosomes (HDs) (3, 4,5). Increased
  expression of alphaEbeta4 and changes in its distribution is found to be correlated
  with increased aggressiveness of tumors and poor prognosis (6, 7). Although integrin
  alpha6beta4, can interact with different laminin isoforms, its preferred ligand
  in the epidermal BM is laminin-5 (8, 9). The beta4 integrin is a large protein and
  has a cytoplasmic domain of more than 1000 amino acids (10, 11). This domain contains
  a Na-Ca exchanger (CalX) motif followed by two pairs of type III fibronectin (FNIII)
  domains separated by a connecting segment (CS). It is found to associate with the
  intermediate filament system through plectin and BP230, which are components of
  hemidesmosomes (12,13,14). Interaction of intgrin beta4 with components of hemidesmosomes
  including plectin, BP230 and BP180 is found to be important in signaling events
  associated with cell growth, survival, and migration under physiological and pathological
  conditions.  Studies have shown that beta4 can regulate keratinocyte migration both
  positively and negatively (15,16,17,18). It is also found to regulate cell survival
  in keratinocytes in cell culture systems under stress in a PI3K/Akt pathway dependent
  manner (19,18). However, alpha6beta4 was not found to have any effect on keratinocyte
  survival in vivo (20, 18, 16). Apart from its effects on keratinocytes, evidence
  suggests that integrin alpha6beta4 is important in cancer cell invasion (21,22,23,24)
  and survival (25,26,27,28,16,29). The cancer cell invasion is regulated through
  a IRS/PI3K dependent process while the effect on carcinoma cell survival in a PI3K/Akt
  and dependent manner. Activation of the transcription factors NFkappaB and NF-IL6
  in a p38Mapk dependent pathway and subsequent activation of IL6 gene expression
  was shown to be mechanism of alpha6beta4 induced survival of thymocytes and proliferation
  of thymic epithelial cells (27,30). Integrin alpha6beta4 is also known activate
  the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade which is found to be involved in the regulation of cell
  cycle (31,32,33,34). NetPath (http://www.netpath.org) is a collaborative project
