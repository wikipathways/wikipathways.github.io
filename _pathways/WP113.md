description: 'The Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway is involved
  in many cellular processes in both the adult organism and the developing embryo
  including cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cellular homeostasis and
  other cellular functions. In spite of the wide range of cellular processes that
  the TGFβ signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGFβ superfamily
  ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor.
  The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which
  can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus
  where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of target
  gene expression. (source: [WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGF_beta_signaling_pathway)).  Also
