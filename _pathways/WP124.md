description: 'This pathway shows the biotransformation of the chemotherapy prodrug
  irinotecan to form the active metabolite SN-38, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase
  I. SN-38 is primarily metabolized to the inactive SN-38 glucuronide by UGT1A1, the
  isoform catalyzing bilirubin glucuronidation. Irinotecan is used in the treatment
  of metastatic colorectal cancer, small cell lung cancer and several other solid
  tumors. There is large interpatient variability in response to irinotecan, as well
  as severe side effects such as diarrhea and neutropenia, which might be explained
  in part by genetic variation in the metabolic enzymes and transporters depicted
  here. Well-known variants to effect this pathway are the promoter polymorphic repeat
  in UGT1A1 (UGT1A1*28) and the 1236C&amp;gt;T polymorphism in ABCB1. While UGT1A1*28
  genotype has been associated with toxicity, further evidence is needed to describe
  the roles of ABCB1 variants in toxicity.  Source: [http://www.pharmgkb.org/search/pathway/irinotecan/liver.jsp
