description: 'In addition to being a primary structural components of cell membranes,
  phospholipids may also be thought of as a reservoir of signaling molecules. Hydrolysis
  of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) by phospholipase C, for instance,
  generates the signaling molecules inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG). S. cerevisiae catalyzes this reaction via Plc1p, a phosphatidylinositol-specific
  phospholipase C involved in a variety of biological processes including nutrient
  sensing and filamentous growth. On the other hand, degradation of phosphatidylcholine
  (PC) by phospholipase D (Spo14p) yields phosphatidic acid and choline; this activity
  generates PA required for sporulation in S. cerevisiae. A phospholipase C specific
  for PC has yet to be identified in S. cerevisiae, however PC may also serve as substrate
  for phospholipases B (Plb1-3p and Nte1p), which hydrolyze PC to yield glycerophosphocholine
  (GPC) and two fatty acids. Both phospholipases B and D are thought to mediate PC
  turnover in yeast, and phospholipase B (as Plb1p) has also been implicated in acyl
  chain remodeling.  Source: [yeastgenome.org](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/)'
