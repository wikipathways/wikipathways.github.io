  title: Metabolomic effects of CeO2, SiO2 and CuO metal oxide nanomaterials on HepG2
    cells (2017)
description: 'Glycogen, a branched polymer of glucose, is a storage molecule whose
  accumulation is under rigorous control in many cells (CITS: 11152943). Glycogen
  metabolism increases in response to a wide variety of environmental stresses, including
  heat stress or exposure to sodium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, copper sulfate, high
  levels of ethanol, or weak organic acids, such as sorbate or benzoate (CITS: 11152943).
  Glycogen metabolism also increases in response to conditions of nutrient starvation,
  such as limited nitrogen, carbon, phosphorous, or sulfur, and during diauxic growth
  on glucose (CITS: 11152943).  Under all of the above conditions, glycogen is degraded
  by Gph1p and Gdb1p enzymes, which are phosphorylase and debranching enzymes respectively
  (CITS: 11152943).   GPH1 progressively releases glucose-1-phosphate from linear
  alpha (1,4)-glucosidic bonds in glycogen (CITS: 2657401)(CITS: 1092346) but is not
  able to break alpha (1,4)-glucosidic bonds that are close to alpha (1,6)-branch
  linkages (CITS: 11152943). The branches are resolved by Gdb1p, which eliminates
  branch points in a two-step process. The first step of the process is the transfer
  of a maltotriosyl (or maltosyl) unit from the branch to an adjacent alpha-1,4-glucosyl
  chain by the oligo-1,4 to 1,4-glucanotransferase activity (EC 2.4.1.25) of Gdb1p
  (CITS: 11094287). The second step is the subsequent hydrolysis of the residual alpha-1,6-linked
  glucose residue by the alpha-1,6-glucosidase activity (EC 3.2.1.33) of Gdb1p (CITS:
  11094287). Once the branch is resolved, Gph1p can continue glycogen degradation
  (CITS: 11152943).  In sporulating cells, glycogen can also be degraded by Sga1p,
  which is a glucoamylase enzyme only expressed during late sporulation (CITS: 11152943).
  SGA1 encodes an amylo (1,4-1,6)-glucosidase (CITS: 11152943) capable of degrading
  glycogen, starch, maltotriose, and maltose into glucose, with maximum activity against
  glycogen at pH 5.5 (CITS: 2493265). The role of glycogen degradation during sporulation
  is not fully understood, since glycogen is rapidly degraded during sporulation in
  wild-type cells, but approximately 90% of all sga1 homozygous null mutants are able
  to produce viable spores (CITS: 11152943).  Thus far, none of the phenotypes seen
  in S. cerevisiae glycogen catabolism mutants correspond to the mammalian glycogen
  storage diseases associated with mutations in human genes involved in glycogen catabolism
  (CITS: 11152943).   SOURCE: SGD pathways, http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/server.html'
