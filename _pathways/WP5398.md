description: Mutations or loss of the NRXN1 gene, located on chromosome 2, is associated
  with severe brain disorders, autism, schizophrenia, and developmental delay. NRXN1
  binds to neurolignins bridging the synaptic cleft. Alternatively spliced NRXN1 and
  NRXN3 influence the expression of NMDA and AMPA receptors.
