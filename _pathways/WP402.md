description: The MAPK signaling proteins are involved in many eukaryotic cellular
  processes and signaling networks. The upstream activation pathways for ERK1 and
  ERK2 are highly similar, and also many of their known downstream targets are common;
  however these genes exhibit different knockdown phenotypes and there are diverse
  roles for these kinases during embryogenesis. For ERK1 specific genes are involved
  in dorsal-ventral patterning and subsequent embryonic cell migration. For ERK2,
  several genes are involved in cell-migration, mesendoderm differentiation and patterning.
