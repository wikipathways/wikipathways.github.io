description: 'Schematic model of the nuclear envelope proteins and their potential
  roles in Emery-Dreyfuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) physiopathology.  Nuclear lamins
  form a meshwork. It interacts with proteins of the nuclear envelope, i.e., EMD,
  LBR, TMPO, SUN, and MAN1, and with several transcription factors. Through nesprin
  proteins, lamins interact with actin microfilaments, microtubules, and cytoplasmic
  intermediate filaments, connecting the nuclear lamina to the extracellular matrix.
  MKL1 translocates into the nucleus and together with SRF induces gene expression.
  In addition, EMD facilitates polymerization of nuclear actin, reducing the nuclear
  export of MKL1 to the cytoplasm. In EDMD cells, emerin mislocalizes and is unable
  to modulate nuclear actin polymerization. G-actin binds to MKL1 and it is exported
  from the nucleus, impairing gene expression. YAP and TAZ are key transcription factors
  for cell proliferation. YAP/TAZ activation causes their nuclear accumulation, promoting
  cell proliferation, and inhibiting differentiation. Nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ
  is increased in patient myoblasts with LMNA mutations. '
