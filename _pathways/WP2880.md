description: The glucocorticoid receptor (GR, a.k.a. NR3C1) is a nuclear receptor
  that is activated upon binding of cortisol or glucocorticoids. It mainly regulates
  gene expression of several groups of genes in two ways. It can stimulate anti-inflammatory
  genes, or inhibit the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes.
