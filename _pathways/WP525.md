description: '"Mitochondria are required for numerous essential metabolic processes
  including the regulation of apoptosis; therefore, proper maintenance of the mitochondrial
  proteome is crucial. The protein-folding environment in mitochondria is challenged
  by organelle architecture, the presence of reactive oxygen species and the difficulties
  associated with assembly of the electron transport chain, which consists of components
  encoded by both the mitochondrial and the nuclear genomes. Mitochondria have dedicated
  molecular chaperones and proteases that promote proper protein folding, complex
  assembly and quality control. Work in cultured mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis
  elegans has yielded clues to the mechanisms linking perturbations in the protein-folding
  environment in the mitochondrial matrix to the expression of nuclear genes encoding
  mitochondrial proteins. Here, we review the current knowledge of this mitochondrial
  unfolded protein response (UPRmt), compare it with the better understood UPR of
  the endoplasmic reticulum and highlight its potential impact on development and
  disease." (Haynes and Ron 2010)'
