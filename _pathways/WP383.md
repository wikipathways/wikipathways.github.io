description: Muscle contraction is the process where muscle tissue is activated by
  a signal from the nervous system. In the case of voluntary action, the nervous signals
  are initiated from the brain by so-called action potentials. With reflexes, these
  potentials are coming directly from the spinal cord. Striated muscles are a group
  of muscles also called skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue.   Proteins on this pathway
  have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP383
  CPTAC Assay Portal].
