  title: IL6-mediated HCoV-host interactome regulatory network and GO/Pathway enrichment
    analysis (2020)
communities: []
description: This pathway is based on Figure 8 of "Parathyroid hormone-related protein
  regulates cell survival pathways via integrin alpha6beta4-mediated activation of
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling."(See Bibliography). Intracrine PTHrP
  inhibits apoptosis by activating the PI3-K/Akt pathway by increasing levels of integrin
  A6B4, which signals in harmony with growth factor receptors. The activation of Akt
  increases the ratio of anti-apoptosis members to pro-apoptosis members in the Bcl-2
  family. The activation of Akt deactivates GSK-3 which leads to higher levels of
  c-myc, therefore leading to lower levels of apoptosis. Overall, intracrine PTHrP
  has the effect of increased cell survival on C4-2 cells.  Proteins on this pathway
  have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3872)
