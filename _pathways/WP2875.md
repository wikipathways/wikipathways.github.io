description: The Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR) is a nuclear receptor and
  functions as a sensor for xenobiotics. It regulates transcription of genes encoding
  proteins in metabolism and excretion of xenobiotics.  Proteins on this pathway have
  targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2875
