description: 'Glial cells, consisting of microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte
  lineage cells as their major components, constitute a large fraction of the mammalian
  brain. Originally considered as purely non-functional glue for neurons, decades

  cells. Source: [10.3389/fncel.2017.00024](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2017.00024).  Proteins
