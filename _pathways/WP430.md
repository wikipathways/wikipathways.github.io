description: 'Statins inhibit endogenous cholesterol production by competitive inhibition
  of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of HMG-CoA to
  mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. This pathway delineates
  genes involved in statin pharmacogenomics, including genes involved in mediating
  the effects of statins on plasma lipoprotein metabolism.   Sources: [PharmGKB](https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA2031)
  and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin)  Proteins on this pathway have
  targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP430).'
