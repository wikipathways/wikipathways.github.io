description: This pathway is based on Figure 2 of "Robo4" (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2637482/).
  The gene Robo4 plays a role in regulating vascular stability in mice. Robo4 inhibits
  the gene Notch1, which regulates tip cell formation, in order to create more tip
  cells. Robo4 also inhibits cell migration, decreasing vessel complexity. The combination
  of Slit2 and Robo4 inhibits the activation of Src by VEGF-165 and VEGFR2. This inhibition
  reduces vascular leakage of Evans Blue from retinal blood vessels. More experimentation
  is necessary to determine whether Robo4 will inhibit other members of the Src family.   Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3943
