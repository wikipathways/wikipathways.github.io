description: RLBP1 encodes CRALBP, a cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein that functions
  as a soluble retinoid carrier in the visual cycle of the eye. Mutations in RLBP1
  are linked to recessively inherited conditions, such as Bothnia dystrophy, retinitis
  pigmentosa, retinitis punctata albescens, fundus albipunctatus, and Newfoundland
  rod-cone dystrophy.
