description: Enterohepatic circulation of bile acids showing the individual transport
  proteins in hepatocytes, ileocytes (ileal enterocytes), and renal proximal tubule
  cells. The reactions depicted in this pathway provide a continuous supply of bile
  acids, which are required for the digestion of food. This transport system also
  reduces fecal and urinary bile acid loss, while also restricting these potentially
  cytotoxic compounds to reach intestinal and hepatobiliary compartments.
