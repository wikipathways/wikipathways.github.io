description: 'Following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, increasing evidence suggests that
  the overactivation of the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway (TKP) plays a significant
  role in the pathophysiology of post-COVID syndrome (PCS). This dysregulation is
  marked by reduced tryptophan (TRP) levels and elevated concentrations of specific
  tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). Notably, heightened TKP activity has been observed
  in patients exhibiting symptoms of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). In fact,
  elevated levels of TKP metabolites such as quinolinic acid, 3- hydroxy anthranilic
  acid and kynurenine, have been associated with cognitive impairments. Persistent
  inflammatory conditions observed in Post-Covid patients potentially upregulate the
  indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzymes, specifically IDO 1, as well as KMO, which
  catalyses the conversion from Kynurenine to 3-Hydroxykynurenine. Thus, the kynurenine
  pathway relates to PACS and potentially enables future biomarker and therapeutic
  possibilities. '
