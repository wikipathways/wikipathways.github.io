description: 'Following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, increasing evidence suggests that
  the overactivation of the Tryptophan–Kynurenine Pathway (TKP) plays a significant
  role in the pathophysiology of Post-Covid syndrome. This dysregulation is marked
  by reduced tryptophan (TRP) levels and elevated concentrations of specific tryptophan
  catabolites (TRYCATs). Notably, heightened TKP activity has been observed in patients
  exhibiting symptoms of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). In fact, elevated
  levels of TKP metabolites such as quinolinic acid, 3- hydroxy anthranilic acid and
  kynurenine, have been associated with cognitive impairments. Persistent inflammatory
  conditions observed in Post-Covid patients potentially upregulate the indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzymes, specifically IDO 1, as well as KMO, which catalyses
  the conversion from Kynurenine to 3-Hydroxykynurenine. Thus, the kynurenine pathway
  relates to PACS and potentially enables future biomarker and therapeutic possibilities. '
