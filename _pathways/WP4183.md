description: 'The major function of the distal convoluted tubule 1 cell (DCT1 cell)
  in the kidney is to maintain proper iron, solute and water homeostasis. The cells
  are polarized and located in the nephron duct where they have unique transport functions
  which are maintained by specialized K⁺, Na⁺, and Cl⁻ channels in the proximal or
  distal part of the cell. '
