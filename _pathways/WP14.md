description: Sucrose is synthesized from the precursors UDP-glucose and fructose 6-phosphate,
  which are converted into sucrose 6-phosphate by the enzyme sucrose-6-phosphate synthase.
  Sucrose 6-phosphate is then dephosphorylated by sucrose phosphatase, resulting in
  the formation of sucrose, which can be exported to other tissues. Although the reaction
  catalyzed by sucrose 6-phosphate synthase is energetically unfavorable, the hydrolysis
  of sucrose 6-phosphate to sucrose is highly exergonic, driving the overall synthesis
  of sucrose in an essentially irreversible manner.
