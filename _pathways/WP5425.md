description: The T-2 (also T2) toxin is a cause of food poisoning. Metabolisation
  to HT-2 is reported as a detoxification mechanism in mammals. This pathway describes
  the mycotoxin metabolism pathway of T-2 in wheat with putative biotransformation
  products. Compounds were converted into identifiers using the 2D drawings in Figure
  4 from Nathanail et al. 2015. Structure elucidation is detailed in Meng-Reiterer
  et al. 2015.
