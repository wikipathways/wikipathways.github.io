description: 'Fatty acids are essential to all organisms except for archaea; they
  are major constituents of cellular membranes, and are used for energy storage and
  for posttranslational protein modifications. Most organisms are capable of synthesizing
  long chain (C12:0-C16:0) saturated fatty acids de novo. Although the initiation
  and termination reactions may vary, the cyclic series of chain-lengthening reactions
  are essentially the same across all organisms. The fatty acid chain, which starts
  as a 2-carbon chain from acetyl-CoA, is extended two carbons at a time by the addition
  of an acetyl group from malonyl-CoA. When the final length of the fatty acid is
  achieved, fatty acid synthesis is terminated. Each cycle of chain elongation involves
  5 reactions with the following enzymatic activities: malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),
  ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41), ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100), 3-hydroxyacyl
  dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61), and enoyl-acyl reductase (EC:
  1.3.1.10). In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release of fatty
  acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries out de
  novo fatty acid biosynthesis. Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are the main
  products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small amounts.
  To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are
  required. The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation
  of acetyl-CoA (EC 6.4.1.2) by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (Acc1p). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase (Bpl1p).  The
  yeast FAS complex catalyzes a total of 8 reactions. The alpha subunit(Fas2p) catalyzes
  3 reactions, ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41),ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100)
  and self pantetheinylation and the yeast beta subunit (Fas1p) catalyzes 5 reactions,
  acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.38), malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),3-hydroxyacyl
  dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61),enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10),
  and palmitoyl transferase (EC:2.3.1.-).  FASs are regulated at the transcriptional
  and translational level as well as posttranslationally. In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping
  enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also
  activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 and theinositol/choline-responsive
  transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p. The coordinate expression of the
  two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of
  FAS2. The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess
  subunits. While the intact FAS multimeric complex (alpha6beta6) is stable, its individual
  subunits are rapidly degraded.  Description source: [YeastPathways](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/).'
