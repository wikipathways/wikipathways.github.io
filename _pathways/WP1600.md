description: Nicotine results in many metabolites after metabolization in the liver.  Nicotine
  is the main factor behind smoking addiction, therefore nicotine supplements can
  be used to stop smoking.   Nicotine is metabolized by several enzymes in the liver
  such as the CYP2A6 enzyme. CYP2A6 is a xenobiotic (xenos = foreigner, bios = life)
  metabolizer.   How well nicotine can be metabolized by the human body is not standard
  and depends on racial, gender, genetic and environmental factors.   The cotinine
  metabolite seen above in the center of the nicotine metabolism pathway is a smoking
  biomarker and can been measured in various tissues such as blood, urine and sweat.
