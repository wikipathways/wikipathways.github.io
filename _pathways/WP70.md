description: 'Trehalose is a storage carbohydrate that can either be synthesized or
  obtained from the external environment. To be utilized as a carbon source, trehalase
  (EC:3.2.1.28) must convert trehalose and water into two molecules of glucose. S.
  cerevisiae has two trehalase enzymes, one is an acid trehalase encoded by ATH1 and
  the other is a neutral trehalase encoded by NTH1. The name "acid" or "neutral" are
  based on the optimal pH of each enzyme (pH 4.5-5.0 and pH 6.8-7.0, respectively).  Each
  trehalase enzyme is active in a different subcellular location. Nth1p occurs as
  homodimer that is located in the cytoplasm, and is required for the hydrolysis of
  intracellular trehalose. Intracellular trehalose either results from trehalose biosynthesis,
  or to a lesser degree from uptake of trehalose from the environment via the Mal11p
  transporter. Ath1p was originally predicted to be a vacuolar protein, but has been
  experimentally shown to mainly localize in the periplasmic space, with a small fraction
  also occurring in the cell wall. Extracellular trehalose is hydrolysed into 2 glucose
  molecules by Ath1p.  Source: http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/YEAST/NEW-IMAGE?object=TREDEG-YEAST-PWY'
