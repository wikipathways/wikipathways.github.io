description: 'The pathway of valine biosynthesis is a four-step pathway that shares
  all of its steps with the parallel pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis (https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP250.html).
  These entwined pathways are part of the superpathway of branched chain amino acid
  biosynthesis, that generates not only isoleucine and valine, but also leucine.  As
  a consequence of having several of its component enzymes involved in the synthesis
  of three different amino acids, the pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis is subject
  to regulation by all three amino acids. The first step in the pathway is primarily
  inhibited by valine, along with inhibition by isoleucine and leucine. The potential
  disruption this might cause to the parallel isoleucine biosynthesis pathway step
  using the same enzymes is resolved by upregulation of an earlier step that is unique
  to isoleucine biosynthesis, as explained in the L-isoleucine biosynthesis I (from
  threonine) summary. In this way, valine biosynthesis can be regulated independently
  of isoleucine biosynthesis, despite all four valine biosynthesis enzymes also participating
  in isoleucine biosynthesis.  SOURCE: SGD pathways, [yeastgenome.org](http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/server.html)'
