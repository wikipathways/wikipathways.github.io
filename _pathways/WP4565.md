description: Neural crest cells migrate and invade as part of normal development,
  but also as part of neuroblastoma metastasis in cancer. Many of the same growth
  factors, receptors and signaling pathways are involved. The participation of NTRK2
  (TrkB), KIDINS220, and SORT1 (Sortilin) appear to be unique to the cancer signaling
  case, as well as the role for the intracellular domain fragment of NGFR (NGFR-ICD
  or p75ICD).
