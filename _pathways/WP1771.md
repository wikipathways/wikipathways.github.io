description: 'The CDP-choline pathway, first identified by Eugene Kennedy in 1956,
  is the predominant mechanism by which mammalian cells synthesize phosphatidylcholine
  (PC) for incorporation into membranes or lipid-derived signalling molecules. The
  CDP-choline pathway represents one half of what is known as the Kennedy pathway.
  The other half is the CDP-ethanolamine pathway which is responsible for the biosynthesis
  of the phospholipid product phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDP-choline_pathway)'
