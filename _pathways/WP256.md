description: 'O-Acetyl-L-homoserine sulfhydrylase participates in an alternative pathway
  of L-homocysteine synthesis. Cysteine can then be produced by the reverse transsulfuration
  pathway, which involves the conversion of homocysteine to cysteine with the help
  of a cystathionine intermediate. This process takes place in two steps: First, cystathionine-synthase
  (Cys4p) catalyzes a -displacement reaction, whereby the thiol group of homocysteine
  replaces the hydroxyl group of serine, resulting in the formation of cystathionine.
  Second, cystathionine-lyase (Cys3p) catalyzes an ,-elimination reaction, which hydrolyzes
  cystathionine to generate cysteine, -ketobutyrate, and ammonia.'
