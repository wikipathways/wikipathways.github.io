description: TNF related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a small pleiotropic
  cytokine of the TNF super family and its gene is located at chromosome 17p13.1.
  TWEAK has been reported to be expressed in tissues that include heart, brain, kidney
  and also in mononuclear blood cells. The multiple biological activities of TWEAK
  include stimulation of cell growth and angiogenesis, induction of inflammatory cytokines,
  and stimulation of apoptosis. It has been shown to be involved in the induction
  of cellular proliferation in liver cells, osteoblasts, astrocytes, synoviocytes,
  kidney cells and skeletal muscles. Furthermore, TWEAK plays a substantial role in
  cellular differentiation in osteoclasts. TWEAK induces glioma cell survival via
  imparting resistance to cytotoxic agents. It imparts its downstream signaling events
  by binding to its receptor, FGF inducible 14 protein (Fn14). Two modes of TWEAK-Fn14
  (ligand-receptor) interactions have been proposed (i) the ligand dependent interaction
  which involves the higher concentration of homotrimeric TWEAK, that binds to low
  concentration of Fn14 in a heterohexameric complex (ii) ligand-independent interaction
  when the ligand concentration is lower than the receptor concentration which induces
  the ligand independent interaction. The receptors homotrimerize to activate the
  downstream events. The signaling cascades reported under TWEAK-Fn14 interactions
  are the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways and the MAPK pathway. There has
  been a report on crosstalk between Wnt and TWEAK pathways. In myoblasts the PI3K-AKT
  module has been reported to be inhibited under TWEAK stimulus. AKT phosprorylation
  leads to the activation of GSK3β resulting in increase of phospho-GSk3β and active
  β-catenin1 (CTNNB1) (dephosphorylated) levels. GSK3β and β-catenin1 remain associated
  in the cytoplasm, phosphorylation of GSK3β leads to the dissociation of β-catenin1
  (dephosphorylated) resulting in the nuclear translocation of the protein. Despite
  of reports on TWEAK binding to other receptors including CD163 and DR3 the downstream
  events following the binding is yet to be established. The data provided by us would
  foster enormous avenues for further studies on TWEAK associated proteins and the
  related disorders such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. The data would enable
  therapeutic studies by selecting the pathological events and the simultaneous production
  of blocking agents. Despite the minimal amount of data, ours can also be used in
  the overlay of various high throughput data enabling pathway analysis and can be
  accessed by any pathway resource to generate a customized pathway.  Please access
  this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tweak_pathway.html) database.  If
  you use this pathway, please cite Bhattacharjee2012 paper (see below).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2036).
