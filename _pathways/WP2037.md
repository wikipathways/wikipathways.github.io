description: 'Prolactin (PRL), a pleiotropic polypeptide hormone, mostly secreted
  by the lactotrophic cells of anterior pituitary gland and to a lesser extent expressed
  in numerous extra pituitary tissues such as adipose tissue, lymphocytes, blood,
  plasma, skin fibroblasts, mammary epithelial cells, spleen, thymus, breast, prostate
  and sweat glands. Prolactin has been established to be present in all vertebrates
  and involved in more than 300 different effects, which can be ascribed to six broad
  categories: (i) reproduction and lactation, (ii) growth and development, (iii) endocrinology
  and metabolism, (iv) brain and behaviour, (v) immunomodulation and (vi) osmoregulation.
  Prolactin mediates its multiple functions through prolactin receptor (PRLR), a member
  of class I cytokine receptor superfamily. The PRLR comprises of an extracellular
  ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain. PRLR
  is expressed in a wide variety of tissues such as brain, mammary epithelium, liver,
  cerebellum and lymphocytes. Prolactin has been shown to be involved in the progression
  of different forms of cancer such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. Clinically,
  higher levels are found in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus
  erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Reiter''s
  syndrome and Sjogren''s syndrome. Besides 23 kDa full length PRL, a 16-kDa (16K
  PRL) N terminal fragment of prolactin produced by the cleavage by Cathepsin D has
  potent antiangiogenic and vasoconstrictive role in endothelial cells. In rat pulmonary
  fibroblasts cells 16K PRL is found to activate NF-kB pathway. Evidences also suggested
  that it has definite roles in programmed cell death in endothelial cells by activating
  various caspases. Prolactin associates with PRLR and induces the dimerization and
  activation of the receptor. The signaling reactions downstream of the long receptor
  isoform have been studied well and little is known about prolactin actions facilitated
  by short isoform. Since PRLR lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, it initiates
  signal transduction through its associated kinases in the cytoplasmic tail. PRL
  signaling activate Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK),
  Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3- kinase), Src kinase and serine/threonine kinase
  Nek3-vav2-Rac1 pathways through the long isoform of the receptor. The prolactin
  signaling through short isoform can activate different downstream cascades except
  JAK/STAT pathway. JAK2 phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues of the receptor
  PRLR and enables the binding of downstream signaling molecules mainly signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. The STATs are considered as major
  effectors for PRL-dependent cell proliferation and gene activation, with STAT5 serving
  as the primary mediators. The phosphorylated STAT proteins dimmerize, translocate
  to the nucleus, and bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of PRL-induced
  genes, activating gene transcription. Prolactin signaling also activates MAP kinase
  pathways and is reported to be involved in proliferation of normal and mammary tumor
  cells. Prolactin also stimulates PI-3K pathway and is reported that activation of
  PI-3K/AKT pathway initiates cell survival of lymphoid cells. Upon prolactin stimulation,
  the adapter protein GAB2 phosphorylated at the tyrosine residue recruits the catalytic
  subunit of PI-3K. Apart from these, prolactin also regulates cytoskeletal re-organization
  through the activation of Rac pathway. The Prolactin receptor dependent interactions
  of serine/threonine kinases NEK3 with guanine nucleotide exchange factors VAV1 and
  VAV2 and Tec with VAV1 regulate cytoskeleton remodeling.  Please access this pathway

  pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2037
