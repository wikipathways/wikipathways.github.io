description: Accumulation of ABA during seed development has been associated with
  maturation of the seed, development of desiccation tolerance and suppression of
  vivipary. Rapid increases of ABA has also been linked to water stress-induced closure
  of stomata. This pathway has been manually created based on Lycocyc content.
