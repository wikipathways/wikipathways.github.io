  title: Circulating miRNAs as Epigenetic Mediators of Periodontitis and Preeclampsia
    Association (2022)
description: A model for DNA damage, inflammation, NAD+, and aging. Two key events,
  the activation of PARP by DNA damage and the decreased NAMPT expression associated
  with inflammation, lead to decreased SIRT1 and SIRT3 activity in the nucleus and
  mitochondria, respectively. Decreased SIRT1 activity is associated with further
  PARP activation and increased DNA damage. Decreased SIRT1 also leads to NF-kB activation
  and decreased FOXO3a activity, two factors that lead to increased inflammation.
  These contribute to the establishment of two parallel feed-forward self reinforcing
  loops that further accelerate the aging process. This process is initiated earlier
  and faster in patients with DNA damage repair defects (such as CS, XPA, and AT).
  Mitochondrial function is diminished as a result of decreased SIRT3 activity, leading
  to mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation, whereas decreased SIRT1 is associated
  with decreased TFAM (necessary for mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription)
  and decreased PGC-1a (necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis). Possible therapeutic
  interventions to restore NAD+ levels are illustrated for each of the key enzymes
  (red arrows). Based on fig 4 from http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6265/1208.long.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3630
