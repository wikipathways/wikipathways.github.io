description: Cardiolipin is one of the important phospholipid present in the inner
  membrane of mitochondria and plays an important role in ATP synthesis mediated by
  oxidative phosphorylation. Pathway is mirrored from the RiceCyc pathway database
  provided by the Gramene project (www.gramene.org). gene assignments are based on
  the sequence homology.
