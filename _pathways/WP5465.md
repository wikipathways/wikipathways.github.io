description: 'The Fanconi anemia pathway is a biochemical network that helps repair
  DNA, replicate DNA, and perform other cellular functions. The pathway''s main function
  is to remove DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), which are barriers that can prevent
  DNA replication and genetic transcription. The Fanconi anemia pathway uses components
  from other DNA repair processes, including: Homologous recombination (HR), Nucleotide
  excision repair (NER), and Translesion synthesis (TLS). The pathway also helps stabilize
  replication forks and regulate cytokinesis.'
