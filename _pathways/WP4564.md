description: During normal neuronal development, neural crest cells participate in
  migration and invasion processes. The growth factor BDNF binds to and activates
  NGFR (p75NTR) in various contexts, invoking signaling pathways that lead to transcriptional
  activation in the nucleus.  Also see the closely related pathway, "Neural crest
  cells in cancer" ([WP4565](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4565)).
