description: 'Bile Acid Synthesis and Enterohepathic Circulation.  In hepatocytes,
  cholesterol is acquired through de novo synthesis as well as receptor-mediated endocytosis
  of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins. Cholesterol is eliminated through bile acid synthesis
  and secretion. The first (and rate-limiting) step in cholesterol conversion  to
  bile acids is catalyzed by CYP7A1. Bile acids are then secreted into the bile via
  ABCB11 and released into the small intestine. The majority of bile acids are re-absorbed
  into the enterocytes via ASBT and transported back to the liver via portal circulation
  via NTCP.  In the hepatocyte, bile acids activate FXR, which inhibits CYP7A1. In
  the small intestine, bile acids also activate FXR to induce FGF15, which subsequently
  binds and activates FGFR4, leading to inhibition of CYP7A1, partially via ERK signaling.
  Based on figure 1 in [Wang et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653253).   '
