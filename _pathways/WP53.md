description: 'The Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins belong to the class V HLH
  family of transcription factors. Four ID proteins (ID 1-4)are known in humans. Unlike
  the basic HLH (bHLH) transcription factors, ID proteins lack the basic DNA binding
  region. They can heterodimerize with class I bHLH transcription factors to form
  inactive complexes. They thus act as dominant negative inhibitors of the class I
  bHLH transcription factors. They are also capable of regulating the activity of
  class II HLH transcription factors. Since, class I and II HLH proteins regulate
  the expression of cell type-specific genes and differentiated phenotype, ID proteins
  are thought to regulate the cross-talk between the pathways involved in cell growth
  and differentiation. Aberrant expression of ID proteins are found in many primary
  tumors and are found to regulate many steps in cancer progression including neo-angiogenesis,
  invasion and migration, proliferation and growth, cell-cell interaction and differentiation.
  These include head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,
  melanoma, hepatocellular carcinonoma, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical
  cancer, breast cancer  and prostate cancer. Among the transcription factors that
  ID proteins associate with are the Ets family members (ELKs)  and paired box family
  (PAXs). They can also bind to the retinoblastoma and retinoblastoma-like proteins
  (RBLs), which are thought to be tumor suppressors. IDs can also be phosphorylated
  by CDK2.    Please access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/id_pathway.html)
