description: 'For initial entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
  (SARS-CoV-2) into cells, the large viral Spike (S) protein needs to be primed by
  host proteases. For SARS-CoV-2 that is the serine protease TMPRSS2. After binding
  to its functional receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the virus undergoes
  endocytosis. After endocytosis of the viral complex, surface ACE2 is further down-regulated,
  resulting in unopposed angiotensin 2 accumulation. Local activation of the angiotensin
  pathway system may mediate lung injury responses to viral insults.  ACE denotes
  angiotensin-converting enzyme and ARB angiotensin-receptor blocker. '
