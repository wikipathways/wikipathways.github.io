description: 'PAFAH1B1 located on chromosome 17p13.3 (exact position chr17:2496923-2588909,
  GRCh37, position from Kirov et al. 2014 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.07.022) is responsible
  for the rare genetic disorder Miller-Dieker syndrome (MIM # 247200). The most common
  symptom is lisencephaly causing severe intellectual disability, cardiac and facial
  dysmorphic features. The protein is part of the type I platelet-activating factor
  acetylhydrolase and involved in stabilising dynein binding to microtubules.  '
