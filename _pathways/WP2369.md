description: Histones can undergo many post-translational modifications that are involved
  in transcription regulation. This pathway provides an overview of various  modifications
  for histones H3 and H4 and the enzymes that catalyze the modifications, where known.   Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2369)
