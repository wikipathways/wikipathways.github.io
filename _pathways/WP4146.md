description: Overview of macrophage markers. Macrophages are cells within the tissues
  that originate from specific white blood cells called monocytes.   Based on [this
  list](http://www.antibodybeyond.com/reviews/cell-markers/macrophage-marker.htm)
  and tissue-specific gene expression from [GeneAtlas](http://biogps.org/).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4146).
