description: 'Triacylglycerol (TAG) is the major lipid reserve in plants and animals.
  The assembly of TAG occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Four consecutive reactions
  are catalyzed by ER membrane bound enzymes. The two intermediates, phosphatidate
  and 1,2-diacylglycerol, are also substrates for the synthesis of membrane lipids
  glycosylglycerides and phosphoglycerides. Thus, the last step in the pathway, catalyzed
  by diacylglycerol acyltransferase, is the only dedicated step in triacylglycerol
  synthesis.  Source: [yeastgenome.org](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/).'
