description: The sphingolipid metabolites and genes (with the gene abbreviations shown
  in boxes, or enzyme names where gene names are ambiguous) are given for the condensation
  of serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketosphinganine (3-ketoSa) by serine palmitoyltransferase,
  which is reduced to sphinganine (Sa), acylated to dihydroceramides, DHCer, by (DH)Cer
  synthases, and incorporated into more complex DH-sphingolipids (the 1-phosphate,
  DHCerP, sphingomyelins, DHSM, glucosylceramides, DHGlcCer, galactosylceramides,
  DHGalCer, lactosylceramides, DHLacCer, and sulfatides, or desaturated to Cer followed
  by headgroup addition. Also included are a number of the catabolic genes, e.g.,
  sphingomyelinases, SMases, ceramidases, ASAH, sphingosine kinases, for the formation
  of sphinganine 1-phosphate (Sa1P) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (So1P), and phosphatases
  for the reverse reaction and the lyase that cleaves sphingoid base 1-phosphates
  to ethanolamine phosphate (EP), hexadecanal (C16:0al) and hexadecenal (C16:1al).  This
  pathway has been updated with information from Lipidmaps>Sphingolipids [https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php].
  Metabolites and proteins from this pathway are coloured orange and have a rounded
  rectangle shape (where an oval shape indicates that the node only occures in the
  LipidMaps pathway). Reactions occurring in the lipidmaps pathways are coloured orange
  (where a dashed line indicates that the reaction only occures in the LipidMaps pathway).
