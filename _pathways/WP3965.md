description: 'Lipid metabolism is the break down or storage of fats for energy.  These
  fats are obtained from food or synthesized by an animal''s liver. Lipid metabolism
  occurs in plants, though the processes differ in some ways compared to animals.
  Lipogenesis is the process of synthesizing fats. Lipid metabolism often begins with
  hydrolysis, which occurs when a chemical breaks down as a reaction to coming in
  contact with water. Since lipids (fats) are hydrophobic, hydrolysis in lipid metabolism
  occurs in the cytoplasm which ends up creating glycerol and fatty acids. Due to
  the hydrophobic nature of lipids they require special transport proteins known as
  lipoproteins, which are hydrophilic. Lipoproteins are categorized by their density
  levels. The varying densities between the types of lipoproteins are characteristic
  to what type of fats they transport. Some lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver;
  others originate elsewhere. Description source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3965).'
