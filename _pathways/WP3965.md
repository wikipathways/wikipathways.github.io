description: 'Lipid metabolism is the break down or storage of fats for energy; these
  fats are obtained from consuming food and absorbing them or they are synthesized
  by an animal''s liver. Lipid metabolism does exist in plants, though the processes
  differ in some ways when compared to animals. Lipogenesis is the process of synthesizing
  these fats. Lipid metabolism often begins with hydrolysis, which occurs when a chemical
  breaks down as a reaction to coming in contact with water. Since lipids (fats) are
  hydrophobic, hydrolysis in lipid metabolism occurs in the cytoplasm which ends up
  creating glycerol and fatty acids. Due to the hydrophobic nature of lipids they
  require special transport proteins known as lipoproteins, which are hydrophilic.
  Lipoproteins are categorized by their density levels. The varying densities between
  the types of lipoproteins are characteristic to what type of fats they transport.
  A number of these lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver, but not all of them
  originate from this organ. Description source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism
  Wikipedia]  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3965
