description: Depression has been linked to (lack of) sunlight exposure and raised
  intracellular calcium levels. In this pathway, the role of the vitamin D pathway
  in calcium signaling in depression is shown. Active 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 is
  formed from 7-dehydrocholesterol by multiple conversion steps. It associates with
  RXR and VDR in the nucleus, which stimulates transcription of VDR target genes,
  resulting in lower intracellular calcium levels. Less sunlight exposure results
  in lower 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels and therefore higher calcium levels.
