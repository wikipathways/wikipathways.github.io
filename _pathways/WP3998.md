description: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are diseases that
  are both caused by a deletion in the same region of chromosome 15, namely  15q11-q13
  (exact position chr15:22805313-28390339 (GRCh37) taken from Kirov et al. 2014 and
  literature cited there). Due to methylation patterns however, different genes are
  responsible for the two syndromes. This pathway depicts the currently known downstream
  molecular interactions of several of the genes involved in PWS and/or AS. For this
  chromosomal region, also duplications are known.   The colours of the pathway sections
  correspond to the colours of the genes on top. Dashed lines indicate a gap between
  a component and the downstream pathway. A rectangle is drawn to improve the clarity
  of the pathway; darker colours indicate that this particular part is derived from
  research in other animals than humans.  A detailed description of the pathway has
  been published by [Ehrhart et al.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15622975.2018.1439594).
  The published version is WP3998-94544.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays
  available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3998).
