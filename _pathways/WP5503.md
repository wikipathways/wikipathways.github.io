description: '"A model for the molecular synergy between β2-agonists and GCs in modulating
  airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction in asthma. Glucocorticoids mediate their
  cellular responses by activating cytosolic GRα or mGR. The genomic effects of GCs
  modulate gene expression, which can typically take hours to occur. In contrast,
  GCs can also have nongenomic effects, which occur immediately or within minutes.
  GCs can also enhance cAMP generation induced by β2-agonists that can then inhibit
  a variety of procontractile signaling events to reverse bronchoconstriction."  From
