  cells. In this pathway, TGF-β binds to the TGF-β-type II receptor, inducing the
  activation of the TGF-β-type-I receptor. This induces the phosphorylation of Smad2/3
  proteins which form a complex with Smad4. The translocation of this complex to the
  nucleus is facilitated by the TAZ protein.  Once in the nucleous, it binds to SBEs
  (Smad Binding Elements), promoting the transcription of TGF-beta-response genes.
  The inhibition of this translocation instead occurs when phosphorylated TAZ protein
  interacts with 14-3-3 protein preventing the formation of complex TAZ-Smad.  The
  translated ECM proteins are secreted by TM cells to the extracellular space.   This
  pathway is based on Figure 4 of the publication “Mutual regulation of the Hippo/Wnt/LPA/TGF-β
  signaling pathways and their roles in glaucoma (Review)” by Xin Wang, Guoli Huai,
  Hailian Wang, Yuande Liu, Ping Qi, Wei Shi, Jie Peng, Hongji Yang, Shaoping Deng,
  and Yi Wang.
