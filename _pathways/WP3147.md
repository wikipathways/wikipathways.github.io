description: The NOD (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) proteins NOD1 and
  NOD2 have important roles in innate immunity as sensors of microbial components
  derived from bacterial peptidoglycan. The importance of these molecules is underscored
  by the fact that mutations in the gene that encodes NOD2 occur in a subpopulation
  of patients with Crohn's disease, and NOD1 has also been shown to participate in
  host defence against infection with Helicobacter pylori.
