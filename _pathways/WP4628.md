description: 'Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into
  pyruvate, CH3COCOO- and H+. The free energy released in this process is used to
  form the ATP and NADH. This pathway was made during a research project at the UMCG,
  concerning changed glycolytic fluxes during the Warburg effect. It is an extended
  version of the glycolysis pathway (WP534), and is descriptive of the content that
  is provided in the computer model of the corresponding supplement, and the article
  of [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009227 Shestov et al., 2014]. For the
  purposes of this WikiPathways model, the passive transport of oxygen and lactic
  acid into the cell is depicted using dashed arrows, which may differ from the original
  computer model.   This pathway was uploaded to provide a high resolution version
  to readers of the thesis. Description and pathway adapted from [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP534]
