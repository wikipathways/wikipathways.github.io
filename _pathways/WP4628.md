description: 'Glycolysis converts glucose, C₆H₁₂O₆, into pyruvate, CH₃COCOO- and H⁺.
  The free energy released in this process is used to form the ATP and NADH. This
  pathway shows changed glycolytic fluxes during the Warburg effect. It is an extended
  version of the glycolysis pathway ([WP534](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP534)),
  and describes content in the computer model of the corresponding supplement, and
  the article of [Shestov et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009227).
  Passive transport of oxygen and lactic acid into the cell is depicted using dashed
  arrows, which may differ from the original computer model.   Referred article: [Shestov
  et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009227)'
