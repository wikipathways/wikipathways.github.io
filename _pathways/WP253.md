description: 'Glycolysis, which was first studied as a pathway for the utilization
  of glucose, is one of the major pathways of central metabolism, the other two being
  the pentose phosphate pathway and the TCA cycle. Glycolysis is essential under all
  conditions of growth, because it produces six of the 13 precursor metabolites that
  are the starting materials for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules
  and other needed small molecules (the six compounds are β-D-glucose 6-phosphate,
  β-D-fructofuranose 6-phosphate, glycerone phosphate, 3-phospho-D-glycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate,
  and pyruvate). Glycolysis can be found, if at least in part, in almost all organisms.  Source:
