description: Several hospitals and researchers have reported links between thrombosis
  and anticoagulation quite regularly for COVID-19 patients.  This pathways combines
  this information, including biological mechanisms involved, in one graphical overview.
  The D-dimer is one of the protein fragments produced when a blood clot dissolves
  within the (human) body; when not properly degraded could lead to thrombosis.  The
  graphical visualisation of (crosslinked) fibrin mesh leading to D-dimers is inspired
  by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-dimer Wikipedia].
