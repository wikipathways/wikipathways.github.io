description: 'This process describes the conversion of precursor messenger RNA into
  mature messenger RNA (mRNA).  The pre-mRNA molecule undergoes three main modifications.
  These modifications are 5'' capping, 3'' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing, which
  occur in the cell nucleus before the RNA is translated.  5'' Capping: Capping of
  the pre-mRNA involves the addition of 7-methylguanosine (m7G) to the 5'' end. The
  cap protects the 5'' end of the primary RNA transcript from attack by ribonucleases
  that have specificity to the 3''5'' phosphodiester bonds.  3'' Processing: The pre-mRNA
  processing at the 3'' end of the RNA molecule involves cleavage of its 3'' end and
  then the addition of about 200 adenine residues to form a poly(A) tail. As the poly(A)
  tails is synthesised, it binds multiple copies of poly(A) binding protein, which
  protects the 3''end from ribonuclease digestion.  Splicing: RNA splicing is the
  process by which introns, regions of RNA that do not code for protein, are removed
  from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous
  molecule.   Description adapted from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-transcriptional_modification  Pathway
  adapted from http://www.reactome.org.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays
  available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP411 CPTAC
