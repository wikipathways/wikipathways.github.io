description: FBXL10, a member of Polycomb repressive complexes, is overexpressed in
  human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tissues and cell lines. FBXL10 silences the
  expression of DUSP6 through recruitment of polycomb repressuive complexes, which
  leads to the deposition of repressive histone modifications in the DUPS6 promoter.
  DUSP6 is a ERK1/2 (MAPK1/MAPK3) phosphatase and with lower levels of DUSP6, ERK1/2
  remain phosphorylated and thus activates downstream ERK/MAPK signaling and ultimately
  cell proliferation. Based on figure 7 in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5833345/
