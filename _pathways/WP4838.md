description: This pathway includes the proximal tubule epithelial kidney cells (NRK52E
  cell) with a basolateral and apical side and other schematic illustrated organelles
  involved in the process of kidney function. The influence of regucalcin on the intra-and
  extracellular Ca2+ regulation is showed which are both involved in cell proliferation,
  ion transport and apoptosis and are important in normal kidney function. When the
  regulation of regucalcin and other factors are downregulated and suppressed the
  kidney fails in functionality and so renal fibrosis will develop. First of all,
  TNF-B and TNF-a do have an impact on the activity of Smad which has an impact on
  the development of a-SMA that induced renal fibrosis. NF-kB, stimulated by TNF-a,
  activates the transcription factor p65 that induced the IL-8 expression which is
  involved in inflammatory pathways. On the other hand, regucalcin inhibits the a-SMA
  which means that the formation of renal fibrosis is inhibited. Further, TNF-B stimulates
  the caspase 8 that activates the cytochrome C which activate the apoptosis pathway.
  Also, here regucalcin function as an inhibitor for Apaf1 that results in an inhibition
  of the apoptosis pathway and activate the Bcl-2 (suppressor of apoptotic cell death).
  Besides the TNF-B and TNF-a pathway, there is an RTK pathway illustrated which activates
  the PI3K and RAS pathway for stimulation of the protein and cell proliferation.
  According to Yamaguchi M. (2015), regucalcin activates the Akt1 to induce the protein
  proliferation even further when PI3K is inhibited. The RTK pathway shows interaction
  with the cAMP pathway that stimulate the protein kinase A and the PIP2 pathway that
  stimulate the protein kinase C and IP3. These all will stimulate Ca2+ release from
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This Ca2+ can migrate and enters the mitochondria
  through the Ca2+ uniporter which results in the activation of mitochondrial biological
  processes or release of different mitochondrial factors. Hence, calcium controls
  and modulate cell apoptosis and inflammation. MAP3K pathway might be involved in
  the stimulation of RAF1 to induce the cell proliferation and the increase in apoptosis
  by inhibition of Bcl-2 through JNK which is also activated by ROS. Ca2+ released
  by the ER can also bind to calmodulin to form the Ca2+/calmodulin complex that stimulates
  IP3, JNK, NOS, RGPR—p117 and NF1. The latter two proteins are involved in the enhancement
  of regucalcin gene expression. On the other hand, regucalcin can inhibit the activity
  of Ca2+/calmodulin complex and the NOS. Normally, phosphodiesterase binds cAMP that
  induced the degradation of cAMP which results in a decrease of protein kinase A
  that leads to a reduction of ER Ca2+ release. Regucalcin inhibits the phosphodiesterase
  in such a way that cAMP will not be degraded and the ER Ca2+ release can further
  occur. Remaining Ca2+ released from the ER can also transport to the microsomes,
  enters vis Ca2+ uniporter, to induce microsomal activities. This process of microsomal
  Ca2+ uptake can be diminished through the inhibition of IP3 kinase. Regucalcin is
  not only involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ release or uptake, but
  also extracellular Ca2+ by stimulating the Ca2+/ATPase which leads to Ca2+ export.
  Besides that, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is important to be present on the basolateral
  membrane of the proximal tubule epithelial kidney cell to regulate the ion transport.
  On the apical membrane is the TRPV5 receptor present that regulate the import of
  Ca2+ from the lumen back into the kidney cell, but Ca2+ can also travel via paracellular
  transport. Further, in the nucleus the regucalcin has an influence on the inhibition
  of the serine/threonine phosphate (PSP), tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and calcineurin
  gene expression. Normally, PSP stimulates the protein kinase A- and so the ER Ca2+
  release-, PTP stimulates the cell growth and differentiation and calcineurin will
  migrate to the cytoplasm for binding to the Ca2+ and stimulates the formation of
  Ca2+/calmodulin complex. In general, regucalcin regulates the factors and proteins
  involved in ion transport, cell proliferation and apoptosis.
