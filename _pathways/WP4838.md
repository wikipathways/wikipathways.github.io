description: 'This pathway includes the proximal tubule epithelial kidney cells (NRK52E
  cell) with a basolateral and apical side and other schematic illustrated organelles
  involved in the process of kidney function. The influence of regucalcin on the intra-and
  extracellular Ca²⁺ regulation is showed which are both involved in cell proliferation,
  ion transport and apoptosis and are important in normal kidney function. When the
  regulation of regucalcin and other factors are downregulated and suppressed, the
  kidney fails in functionality and so renal fibrosis will develop.   First of all,
  TGF-B (TGFB1) and TNF-a (TNFA) do have an impact on the activity of SMAD2/4 which
  has an impact on the development of a-SMA (ACTA2) that induced renal fibrosis. NF-kB
  (TNFSF11), stimulated by TNF-a, activates the transcription factor p65 (RELA) that
  induced the IL-8 expression which is involved in inflammatory pathways. On the other
  hand, regucalcin inhibits the a-SMA which means that the formation of renal fibrosis
  is inhibited. Further, TGF-B stimulates the caspase 8 (CASP8) that activates the
  cytochrome C which activate the apoptosis pathway. Also, here regucalcin function
  as an inhibitor for APAF1 that results in an inhibition of the apoptosis pathway
  and activate the BCL-2 (suppressor of apoptotic cell death).  Besides the TGF-B
  and TNF-a pathway, there is an RTK pathway illustrated which activates the PI3K
  (PI3K3CA) and RAS (G3BP1) pathway for stimulation of the renal homeostasis, autophagy,
  protein and cell proliferation. According to Yamaguchi M. (2015), regucalcin activates
  the AKT1 to induce the renal homeostasis, autophagy and protein proliferation even
  further when PI3K is inhibited. The RTK pathway shows interaction with the cAMP
  pathway that stimulate the protein kinase A (PRKACA) and the PIP2 pathway that stimulate
  the protein kinase C (PRKCQ) and IP3. These all will stimulate Ca²⁺ release from
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  This Ca²⁺ can migrate and enters the mitochondria
  through the Ca²⁺ uniporter (MCU) which results in the activation of mitochondrial
  biological processes or release of different mitochondrial factors. Hence, calcium
  controls and modulate cell apoptosis and inflammation. MAP3K pathway might be involved
  in the stimulation of RAF1 to induce the cell proliferation and the increase in
  apoptosis by inhibition of BCL-2 through JNK (MAPK10) which is also activated by
  ROS.   Ca²⁺ released by the ER can also bind to calmodulin to form the Ca²⁺/Calmodulin
  complex that stimulates IP3, JNK, NOS, RGPR—p117 (SEC16B) and NF1. The latter two
  proteins are involved in the enhancement of regucalcin gene expression. On the other
  hand, regucalcin can inhibit the activity of Ca²⁺/Calmodulin complex and the NOS.
  Normally, phosphodiesterase (PDE1B) binds cAMP that induced the degradation of cAMP
  which results in a decrease of protein kinase A that leads to a reduction of ER
  Ca²⁺ release. Regucalcin inhibits the phosphodiesterase in such a way that cAMP
  will not be degraded and the ER Ca²⁺ release can further occur. Remaining Ca²⁺ released
  from the ER can also transport to the microsomes, enters vis Ca²⁺ uniporter, to
  induce microsomal activities. This process of microsomal Ca²⁺ uptake can be diminished
  through the inhibition of IP3 kinase.  Regucalcin is not only involved in the regulation
  of intracellular Ca²⁺ release or uptake, but also extracellular Ca²⁺ by stimulating
  the Ca²⁺/ATPase (ATP2B3) which leads to Ca²⁺ export. Besides that, the Na+/Ca²⁺
  exchanger (SLC8A1) is important to be present on the basolateral membrane of the
  proximal tubule epithelial kidney cell to regulate the ion transport. On the apical
  membrane is the TRPV5 receptor present that regulate the import of Ca²⁺ from the
  lumen back into the kidney cell, but Ca²⁺ can also travel via paracellular transport.  Further,
  in the nucleus the regucalcin has an influence on the inhibition of the serine/threonine
  phosphate (PSP), tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and calcineurin (PPP3R1) gene expression.
  Normally, PSP stimulates the protein kinase A- and so the ER Ca²⁺ release-, PTP
  stimulates the cell growth and differentiation and calcineurin will migrate to the
  cytoplasm for binding to the Ca²⁺ and stimulates the formation of Ca²⁺/Calmodulin
  complex.  In general, regucalcin regulates the factors and proteins involved in
  ion transport, cell proliferation and apoptosis.  Research is done on rats.  '
