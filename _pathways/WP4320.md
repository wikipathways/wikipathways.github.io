description: 'The effect of progerin on the involved genes in progeria, also known
  as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Each colored box shows a different
  element of the pathway. The red box on the upper right shows that upregulation of
  the p53 pathway leads to apoptosis and senescence. The box beneath the red one,
  the purple one, indicates the inhibition of the Wnt pathway by progerin which results
  in bone abnormalities. The blue box portrays the epigenetic changes done by heterochromatin
  and euchromatin silencing. The green box shows that progerin activates SKIP which
  stimulates the Notch signaling pathway. The orange box surrounds the Mi-2/NuRD complex
  which is depleted by progerin leading mainly to epigenetic changes. The final yellow
  box shows the inhibition of SERBP1 by progerin resulting in dysfunctional adipose
  tissue. Legend shows basic and MIM-interactions and indication for methylation. '
