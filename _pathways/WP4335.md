description: 'In biochemistry, eicosanoids are signaling molecules made by oxidation
  of twenty-carbon essential fatty acids, (EFAs). They exert complex control over
  many bodily systems, mainly in inflammation or immunity, and as messengers in the
  central nervous system. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosanoid).  This
  pathway is inspired by the [Lipidmaps>Eicosanoids pathway](https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php).
  For Homo sapiens, the information from this pathway has been integrated with the
  pre-existing pathway at [WikiPathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP167).'
