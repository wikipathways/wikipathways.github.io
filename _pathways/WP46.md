description: Cysteine and methionine are sulfur-containing amino acids. Cysteine is
  synthesized from serine through different pathways in different organism groups.
  In bacteria and plants, cysteine is converted from serine (via acetylserine) by
  transfer of hydrogen sulfide. In animals, methionine-derived homocysteine is used
  as sulfur source and its condensation product with serine (cystathionine) is converted
  to cysteine. Cysteine is metabolized to pyruvate in multiple routes. Methionine
  is an essential amino acid, which animals cannot synthesize.   Description from
  [KEGG](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/map00270).
