description: 'The different classess of factors involved in adipogenesis are shown.
  Adipogenesis is the process by which fat cells differentiate from preadipocytes
  to adipocytes (fat cells). Adipose tissue, composed of white and brown adipose tissue,
  is composed of adipocytes. This pathway is primarily studied to understand factors
  that contribute to obesity and diabetes. Transcriptional and hormonal regulators
  of adipocyte formation are indicated.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays
  available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP236) '
