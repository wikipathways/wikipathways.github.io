description: 'The Hedgehog family of proteins are signaling proteins that are crucial
  for a number of physiological processes including morphogenesis during development.
  In adult organisms, it is also involved in the regulation of theca cell development
  in growing follicles and in regulating the development and function of the somatic
  cells of the testis. Vertebrates are known to have 3 Hedgehog genes, which show
  different spatio-temporal expression patterns and perform specialized functions.
  These are - Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and Sonic hedgehog (Shh).
  The Patched (PTCH) proteins (Patched 1 and Patched 2 - PTCH1 and PTCH2) serve as
  receptors for the Hedgehog proteins. In the ''off'' state, PTCH receptors inhibit
  the Smo protein by mechanism(s) which are still not understood completely. In this
  state, the Gli2/3 Zn-finger transcription factors are phosphorylated and processed
  in a proteasome-dependent manner to generate a transcriptionally repressor form.
  SUFU, a cytoplasmic protein, was also found to interact with all the three Gli proteins
  resulting in the repression of its transcriptional activity. In the ''Signaling
  cell'', which is the cell which secretes the Hedgehog proteins, an active ligand
  is produced following processing of the precursor Hedgehog protein. This processing
  involves autocleavage by the catalytic domain and bi-lipidation (cholesterol moiety
  at C-terminus and palmitate at the N-terminus) of the Hedgehog protein. These active
  ligands travel to the ''responding cell'' via interactions with glypicans and megalin.
  On the responding cell, the active ligand interacts with PATCHED 1 (PTCH1) and PATCHED
  2 (PTCH2), which results in the activation and translocation of Smoothed (Smo) to
  the cilium(plasma membrane in Drosophila). Activation of Smo results in the inhibition
  of Gli proteolysis and the production of the transcriptional repressor form. This
  might also promote the formation of the transcription activator form of the protein.
  The G-protein coupled receptor kinase-2 enhances the association between β-arrestin
  2 and Smo probably by phosphorylating Smo. The two proteins also mediates increased
  internalization of Smo in a clathrin- dependent process and increased Hedgehog signaling.
  Kif7, a Drosophila Costal2 (Cos2) homolog, is capable of interacting with the Gli
  proteins and is known to exert positive and negative effects on Hedgehog signaling.
  The Fused (Fu) homolog, which can form a complex with Kif7, Gli and and SuFu (similar
  to Drosophila Gli, Cos2, Su and SuFu) may also be involved in the regulation of
  this pathway.   Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/hedgehog_pathway.html
