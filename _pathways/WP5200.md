description: Dravet syndrome is a rare form of epilepsy. Between 70% and 80% of patients
  carry sodium channel α1 subunit gene (SCN1A) loss of function mutations. Truncating
  mutations (early stop codon) account for about 40% and have a significant correlation
  with an earlier age of seizures onset. The mutations lead to haploinsufficiency
  of the voltage-gated sodium channel α subunit NaV1.1 in the of GABAergic inhibitory
  interneurons in the brain.  Mutations in other genes like KCNA1, CHD2, PCDH19 and
  STXBP1 can also lead to Dravet syndrome.
