  title: Central nervous system and systemic inflammatory networks associated with
    acute neurological outcomes in COVID-19 (2025)
communities:
- COVID19
description: 'Long COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease) ranges from lingering symptoms 6-12
  months after contracting COVID-19 to severe implications caused by the virus. To
  understand the (molecular) mechanisms underlying Long COVID-19 and the potential
  role of chronic oxidative stress, this pathway concisely visualises mitochondrial
  hijacking by SARS-COV-2 leading to pro-senescent mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. '
