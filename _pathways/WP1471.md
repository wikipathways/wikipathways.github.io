description: 'TOR signaling is responsible for a cellular reaction towards nutrient
  and energy availability and hypoxia/stress. The mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR),
  a serine/threonine kinase, is the central regulator that consists in two different
  complexes: a rapamycin-sensitive complex (mTORC1) consisting of mTOR, Raptor and
  GbetaL that regulates mRNA translation, ribosome biogenesis and autophagy and a
  second rapamycin-insensitive complex (mTORC2) consisting of mTOR, Rictor GbetaL,
  Sin1 and Protor 1/2 that regulates survival and a cytoskeletal response. TOR signaling
  is highly integrated in other signaling pathways that respond to external conditions,
  such as the insulin-signaling cascade and AMPK signaling.  Proteins on this pathway
  have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1471).'
