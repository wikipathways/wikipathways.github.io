description: In prometaphase, highly condensed chromosomes establish bipolar attachments
  to the mitotic spindle. Unattached or mal-orientated chromosomes generate a signal
  to delay the onset of anaphase until all pairs of sister chromatids are properly
  aligned on the metaphase plate. This signal is transduced by a relay of spindle-checkpoint
  proteins, including MAD1, MAD2, BUB1, BUBR1, BUB3 and centrosome protein E (CENPE),
  which inhibits cell division cycle 20 (CDC20)-mediated activation of an E3 ubiquitin
  ligase, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Following attachment and
  alignment of all the chromosomes at metaphase, the checkpoint signal is silenced
  and APC/C initiates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of securin and activation
  of separase. Separase in turn cleaves a multiprotein complex termed cohesin, which
  creates physical links between sister chromatids to initiate anaphase. This process
  may be of interest in colorectal cancer, specifically in terms of the chromosome
  instability phenotype, which could result from defects in pathways that ensure accurate
  chromosome segregation.   Adapted from Pino et al.  Proteins on this pathway have
  targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4240
