description: 'Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature,
  is central to a number of physiological conditions, from embryogenesis to wound
  healing in adults and is a hallmark of pathological conditions such as tumorigenesis
  [1-3]. Angiogenesis is mediated by the coordinated action of a variety of growth
  factors, metabolites and cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells [4-6]. Vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the principal angiogenic growth factor modulating
  neovascularization [7].  The biological effect of VEGF is mediated through specific
  VEGF receptors on endothelial cell surface. VEGFs (VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGF-D)
  interact with VEGF receptors such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3. Among them, VEGFA/VEGFR2
  signaling appears to mediate cellular responses involved in angiogenesis prominently.
  Further, VEGF/VEGFR1 signaling, though weak, converges to VEGFR2 signaling pathway.
  VEGFA binding to VEGFR2 at the surface of endothelial cells leads to dimerization
  and auto-phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain
  of VEGFR2. It leads to activation of multiple downstream signaling cascades and
  promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation relevant
  to angiogenesis [8]. VEGFR2 dependent activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling regulates
  cell survival, cell proliferation, anti-apoptotic and cell permeability functions
  [9]. Another important pathway of VEGF mediated cell proliferation appears to be
  through PLCÎ³-mediated activation of PKC and downstream induction of the ERK and
  other PKC-dependent pathways [10]. Endothelial cell migration is induced by VEGFA/VEGFR2
  signaling through activation of p38MAPK (actin polymerization) and FAK (focal adhesion
  turnover) which is particularly important in directed migration. Phosphosite specificity
  towards downstream signalling has also been documented. Phosphosite mapping documented
  seven phosphosites in VEGFR2 receptor: Y1054, Y1214, Y801, Y1175, Y951, Y1059 and
  Y996. Phosphorylation of Y1214 and Y1054 regulates signaling events involved in
  cell migration. Y801 phosphorylation regulates cell survival. Y1175 regulates both
  cell proliferation and migration. Y951 and Y1059 phosphorylation regulates cell
  survival, cell migration and cell proliferation.  VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling network
  compiles data available in the literature with respect to VEGFA signaling (especially
  VEGFA-165) through VEGFR2 in endothelial cells. The signaling events involving these
  proteins were derived from experimentally validated data involving multiple experimental
  techniques and approaches. Individual signaling events in VEGFR2 signaling networks
  leading to cell proliferation, migration and survival were identified and categorized
  into protein-protein interactions, enzyme-catalyzed events, activation/inhibition
  reactions, transport of protein across subcellular compartments, and gene regulation
  events. Signaling molecules involved in VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling were categorized
  to enzymes, receptors and transcription factors and the contextual activation/deactivation
  of these molecules downstream to VEGFA/ VEGFR2 signaling, in modulating angiogenesis,
  is documented.  VEGFA dependent angiogenesis pathway map depicts the integration
  of signaling pathways regulating cell survival, cell migration, cell proliferation,
  cellular interactions downstream of VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling relevant to angiogenesis,
  regulation of VEGFR2, phosphosite specificity of VEGFR2 towards downstream signaling,
  post-translational modifications, molecular function-based information, cross-talks
  among proteins in the canonical signaling modules and the information on the compartmentalization
  of proteins. The map of VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling network is interactive to help investigators
  to add new information as it becomes available in the future for analysis or representation.   VEGFA
  dependent angiogenesis pathway map may please be cited as:   1. Abhinand, C. S.,
