description: Proposed signaling pathways by which MFAP5 induces LPP expression and
  increases the permeability and motility of endothelial cells via cytoskeleton rearrangement.
  The activation of the MFAP5-mediated signaling cascade in endothelial cells up-regulates
  LPP expression and subsequently promotes the motility of endothelial cells and the
  permeability of the endothelial cell monolayer.   Adapted from supplemental figure
  11 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5785271/ Leung et al].
