description: 'Neurotransmitter is stored in the synaptic vesicle in the pre-synaptic
  terminal prior to its release in the synaptic cleft upon depolarization of the pre-synaptic
  membrane. The release of the neurotransmitter is a multi-step process that is controlled
  by electrical signals passing through the axons in form of action potential. Neurotransmitters
  include glutamate, acetylcholine, nor-epinephrine,  dopamine and seratonin. Each
  of the neurotransmitter cycle is independently described.Original Pathway at Reactome:
