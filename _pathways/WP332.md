description: The reactions of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway
  occur in the cytosol and are important for generating NADPH through the oxidative
  reduction of NADP+. NADPH is an important source of the reducing energy required
  by many enzymes in central biosynthetic pathways. Although there are other biochemical
  pathways that generate NADPH in yeast, the pentose phosphate pathway is considered
  the major source of NADPH, and insufficient NADPH probably contributes to the fitness
  defects seen in mutants of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway.
