description: 'Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) network for mitochondrial Complex 1 (C1)
  inhibition leading to adverse outcomes in kidney, brain and liver. Adverse Outcome
  Pathways (AOPs), in general, are defined as a sequence of key events that begins
  with a molecular initiating event (MIE) and leads to an Adverse Outcome. At that
  level, AOPs are described in the [AOPWiki](https://aopwiki.org/). This AOP network
  is based on 3 AOPs: [AOPwiki:3](https://aopwiki.org/aops/3), [AOPwiki:273](https://aopwiki.org/aops/273)
  and [AOPwiki:276](https://aopwiki.org/aops/276).'
