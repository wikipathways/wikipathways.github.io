    human atherosclerotic lesions ex vivo reveal heterogeneity of endothelial subtype

description: This pathway is modeled after Figure 9 in the article "Gremlin utilizes
  canonical and non-canonical TGFB signaling to induce lysyl oxidase (LOX) genes in
  human trabecular meshwork cells". Gremlin is enables the TGF-B signaling pathways
  to oversee LOX and LOXL proteins and also demonstrates that the non-canonical JNK1/2
  complex, canonical SMAD, and P38 signaling pathways are involved in this pathway.
  TGF-B signaling is possible through Gremlin's ability to bock the BMP signaling
  pathway which inhibits TGF-B receptors.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3874)
