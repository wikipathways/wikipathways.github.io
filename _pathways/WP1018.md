description: 'Apoptosis is a distinct form of cell death that is functionally and
  morphologically different from necrosis. Nuclear chromatin condensation, cytoplasmic
  shrinking, dilated endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane blebbing characterize apoptosis
  in general. Mitochondria remain morphologically unchanged. In 1972 Kerr et al introduced
  the concept of apoptosis as a distinct form of "cell-death", and the mechanisms
  of various apoptotic pathways are still being revealed today.  '
