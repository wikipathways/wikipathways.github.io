description: 'IL-4 is a glycoprotein which is composed of 129 amino acids and has
  a molecular weight of 20kDa. IL-4 and IL-13 are produced by CD4+ cells and exhibit
  significant functional overlap. Both these cytokines play a critical role in the
  promotion of allergic responses. IL-4 is primarily involved in promoting the differentiation
  and proliferation of T helper 2 (TH2) cells and the synthesis of immunoglobulin
  E (IgE). Apart from its role in allergic responses including asthma, IL-4 was also
  found to regulate retinal progenitor proliferation, rod photoreceptor differentiation,
  cholinergic and GABAergic amacrine differentiation and neuroprotection and survival.
  IL-4 was also found to have regulatory effects in a number of neurological diseases
  including Alzheimer''s disease, Multiple sclerosis, Experimental autoimmune encephelitis.
  It was also found to relieve inflammatory and neuropathic pain. IL-4 is capable
  of exerting its biological activities through interaction with two cell surface
  receptor complexes - Type I IL4 receptor and Type II IL4 Receptor. Both these receptor
  complexes comprise of a common IL4Rα (CD124) subunit, which is also the functional
  receptor chain. Type I IL-4 receptor is formed by the interaction of IL4Rα subunit
  with IL-2γc (CD132). Type II IL-4 receptor is formed by the interaction of IL-4Rα
  subunit with IL-13Rα. Interaction of IL-4 with its receptor results in receptor
  dimerization and activation. The Type I receptors activates JAK1 and 3, which are
  associated with the receptor subunits. The activated JAK phosphorylates tyrosine
  residues the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor which then serves as docking sites
  for a number of adaptor or signaling molecules including STAT6. Activated STAT6
  dimerizes, translocated to the nucleus and transcriptionally actives genes responsive
  to IL-4. Many of the key functions of IL4 allergic disorders, including TH2 cell
  differentiation, airway hyper responsiveness, mucus cell metaplasia and IgE synthesis
  are dependent on STAT6 activation. Other phosphorylated tyrosine residue bind to
  proteins with phospho-tyrosine binding (PTB) motifs including IRS proteins. This
  results in the phosphorylation of the IRS proteins, which can then potentially activate
  the PI3K/AKT cascade by binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K or the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  cascade. The PI3K/AKT pathway is thought to mediate the growth and survival signals
  in multiple IL-4 responsive cell types including T- and B- lymphocytes and natural
  killer cells.   Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_4_pathway.html
