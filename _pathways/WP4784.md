description: Proteoglycan (PG) synthesis is a complex mechanism that can be divided
  in four main steps. Core protein synthesis occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum
  (RER). Once PG core protein has been synthesized, it moves from the RER to the Golgi
  apparatus where the first sugar of glycosaminoalycan (GAG) chain is added on Ser
  residues. GAG synthesis continues by glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar moieties
  from UDP-sugars to GAG chains. UDP-sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm and are
  translocated in the Golgi apparatus by an antiporter with UMP. Then UDP, the by-product
  of glycosyltransferase reactions, is hydrolyzed to UMP and phosphate by calcium
  activated nucleotidase 1 (CANT1). Chondroitin, dermatan and heparan sulfate synthesis
  starts on a Ser residue of the PG core protein with the formation of a tetrasaccharide
  linkage region composed of a xylose (Xyl), two galactoses (Gal) and a glucuronic
  acid (GlcUA). After tetrasaccharide synthesis, GAG chain elongation continues through
  the binding of specific saccharides defining chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate
  and heparan sulfate. Specific enzymes are involved in this process and mutations
  in their gene cause different types of skeletal dysplasia (indicated in red boxes).
  The third step is GAG sulfation.  Sulfate enters in cells through the SLC26A2 transporter
  and it is activated to 30-phosphoadenosine 50-phosphosulfate (PAPS) by PAPS synthase
  (PAPSS) in the cytosol. Through a PAPS transporter (PAPST), PAPS moves to Golgi
  apparatus where it is used as sulfate donor by sulfotransferases to sulfate GAGs.
  This reaction also produces phosphoadenosine phosphate (PAP), that is hydrolyzed
  into AMP and phosphate by a Golgi resident phosphoadenosine phosphate phosphatase
  (gPAPP). Once synthesized, PGs are secreted in extracellular space.  Sulfation of
  GAGs is an important step in PG synthesis determining PG properties. Inorganic sulfate
  enters in cells through a sulfate/chloride antiporter named SLC26A2, but a small
  amount of sulfate could be derived from sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism.
  To be used by Golgi sulfotransferases, sulfate is activated to 30-phosphoadenosine
  50-phosphosulfate (PAPS), the universal sulfate donor, by PAPS synthase (PAPSS2).
  The by-product of sulfotransferase reactions, phosphoadenosine phosphate (PAP),
  is hydrolyzed by a Golgi resident phosphoadenosine phosphate phosphatase (gPAPP)
  in order to prevent feedback inhibition of these reactions.  Linked with a dotted
  arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are skeletal dysplasias caused by mutation in the
  respective gene.  For further details, see [Paganini et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286677).
