description: 'Acute Myeloid Leukemia is a cancer of the myeloid cell line of blood
  cells of the bone marrow. Rapid growth of cancer cells leads to the accumulation
  of neoplastic blasts in the node marrow, and interferes with the production of normal
  blood cells.  AML develops as the consequence of a series of genetic changes. Two
  major types of changes have been described as crucial for leukemic transformation:
  1. Disordered cell growth and up-regulation of cell survival genes. The most common
  of these activating events are in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and
  sometimes in other RTKs.  2. Alterations in transcription factors regulating hematopoietic
  differentiation. Transcription factor fusion proteins such as AML-ETO, PML-RARalpha
  or PLZF-RARalpha block myeloid cell differentiation by repressing target genes.
  Sometimes the transcription factors themselves are mutated.  This description was
  adapted from KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp/pathway/map=map05221), Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia)
