description: 'Regulation of FABP4 in ovarian cancer. FABP4 (fatty acid binding protein)
  can substantially increase metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells, and leads
  to more aggressive disease. Mir-409-3p negatively regulates FABP4 in ovarian cancer
  cells, and mir-409-3p is decreased in hypoxic conditions. Pink arrows indicates
  potential therapuetic therapeutic stratgeies; in Gharpure et al, DOPC nanoliposomes
  containing either miR-409-3p mimic or FABP4 siRNA was shown to inhibit tumor progression.  Description
  was adapted from Gharpure et al. '
