  title: Genetic risk of depression is different in subgroups of dietary ratio of
    tryptophan to large neutral amino acids (2023)
communities: []
description: 'Stress and anxiety disorders are risk factors for depression and these
  behaviours are modulated by corticotropin releasing factor (CRFR1) and serotonin
  (5-HT2R) receptors. (Source: Berg et al "5-Hydroxytryptamine type 2A receptors regulate
  cyclic AMP accumulation in a neuronal cell line by protein kinase C-dependent and
  calcium/calmodulin-dependent mechanisms").  Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3944).'
