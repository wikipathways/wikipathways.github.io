description: Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers which mediate, amplify, or
  modulate synaptic transmissions between neurons, meaning that many are involved
  in primary brain functions such as movement, pain threshold, memory, and so on.
  The are various disorders associated with neurotransmitter dysfunction, which may
  also be caused by defects in the neurotransmitter transporters. This pathway describes
  various defects including deficiencies of tyrosine hydrolyse (TH), aromatic l-amino
  acid decarboxylase (AADC), dopamine Beta-Hydroxylase (DBH), monoamine oxidase A,
  as well as the heredity dopamine transporter syndrome and the brain dopamine-serotonin
  vesicular transporter (VMAT2) disease.   This pathway was inspired by Edition 5,
  Chapter 19 of the book of Blau (ISBN 9783030677268) (Ed.4 Chapter 31).
