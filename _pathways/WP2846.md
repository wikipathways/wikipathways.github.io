description: 'Exogenously, circulating PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin
  type 9) protein binds to LDLR (LDL receptor). Once internalized into the liver cell,
  the PCSK9 protein directs the LDLR to the lysosome for degradation. Intrinsically,
  PCSK9, which is secreted from the Golgi apparatus, binds the LDLR before it reaches
  the cell surface, leading it to lysosomal degradation. However, the precise mechanisms
  by which the intrinsic degradation pathway operates are still unknown. Abbreviations:
  LDLR, LDL receptor; PCSK9, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9.'
