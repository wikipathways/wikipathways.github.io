description: 'Estrogens are metabolized via hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 enzymes
  such as CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 and via conjugation by estrogen sulfotransferases (sulfation)
  and UDP-glucuronyltransferases (glucuronidation). In addition, estradiol is dehydrogenated
  by 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into the much less potent estrogen estrone.
  These reactions occur primarily in the liver, but also in other tissues.  Description
