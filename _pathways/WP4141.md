  title: 'An NF-κB- and Therapy-Related Regulatory Network in Glioma: A Potential
    Mechanism of Action for Natural Antiglioma Agents (2022)'
description: 'Pathway representation of the model proposed by Ferreira et al. in the
  Figure 7 C of their article: "Proposed model for the mechanism of action of 1,25(OH)2D3
  in human-monocyte-derived DCs. We hypothesize that VDR-bound 1,25(OH)2D3 activates
  the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway via either forming a complex and phosphorylating the regulatory
  subunit of PI3K, or by other unknown mechanisms. This releases and activates the
  catalytic subunit, which unleashes the PI3K downstream pathway. Among other functions,
  activation of this pathway promotes the expression of different key glycolytic enzymes,
  which induces glycolysis. Control of surface marker expression and cytokine production
  by 1,25(OH)2D3 might arise from its impact on the PI3K pathway, which can control
  essential transcription factors (e.g., GSK-3ÃŽÂ² and NF-ÃŽÂºB nuclear translocation)
  or from the direct regulation of transcription factors, key metabolic bifunctional
  enzymes, and RNA binding proteins. In the absence of glucose or glycolysis, an increase
  in the AMP/ATP ratio will be sensed by AMPK, which, in turn, phosphorylates TSC2
  and blocks activation of the mTOR complex and its downstream processes. We further
  consider that the increase in OXPHOS also seen in 1,25D3-DCs is derived from the
  excess pyruvate generated during induced glycolysis, in addition to the control
  of metabolic enzymes from the oxidative branch by 1,25(OH)2D3".   Proteins on this
  pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4141
