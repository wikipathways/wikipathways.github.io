description: 'All major phospholipid classes in yeast may trace their synthesis to
  a common precursor: cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). CDP-DAG is synthesized
  in a reaction catalyzed by CDP-DAG synthase, which converts phosphatidic acid (PA)
  to CDP-DAG using cytidine triphosphate (CTP) as the CDP donor. There are two distinct
  CDP-DAG synthases in S. cerevisiae: Cds1p, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), and Tam41p, localized in the mitochondrial matrix. In the ER, CDP-DAG generated
  by Cds1p can be converted to phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylserine (PS)
  via PI synthase (Pis1p) or PS synthase (Cho1p), respectively. In the mitochondrion,
  CDP-DAG generated by Tam41p can be sequentially converted to phosphatidylglycerol
  (PG), which can be further converted to cardiolipin. Synthesis of PI, PG, and cardiolipin
  occurs through similar mechanisms in mammalian cells; however, unlike yeast, mammals
  primarily synthesize PS from other phospholipids and not from CDP-DAG.  Source:
