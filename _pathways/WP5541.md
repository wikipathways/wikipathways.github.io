description: 'Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin essential
  for neuron growth, differentiation, plasticity, and survival. BDNF binds tropomyosin-related
  kinase B (TrkB) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) with low affinity. Binding
  to TrkB activates the receptor through dimerization and autophosphorylation, which
  leads to phosphobinding sites for adaptor proteins FRS2, SCH1, and SH2B2. These
  adaptor proteins activate CREB1 through the RAS/ERK pathway. IRS1/2 activates the
  PI3K/AKT pathway, resulting in the activation of beta-catenin. TrkB can form a complex
  with p75NTR, resulting in the activation of kiddins220, activating the RAS/ERK pathway
  from a different route. Binding of pto-BNDF to the P75NTR Sortilin dimer resulted
  in the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as RAC1/CDC42, TRADD/FAD, activating
  MAPK8 and caspase 8, respectively. Additionally, pro-BDNF binding induces the synthesis
  of ceramides, resulting in the inhibition of RAS. '
