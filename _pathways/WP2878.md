description: PPAR alpha (also known as NR1C1) is a nuclear receptor that is involved
  with transcriptional regulation of genes involved in beta-oxidation, metabolism,
  fatty acid transport, etc.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available
  via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2878).
