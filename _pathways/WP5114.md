description: This pathway describes the process of Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)
  in Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP). Nucleotide excision repair is a DNA repair mechanism
  that repairs DNA damaged by UV radiation. This type of damage produces bulky distortions
  in the shape of DNA double helix due to the addition of DNA adducts, mostly thymine
  dimers and 6,4-photoproducts.  Recognition of distortions leads to the removal of
  a short single-stranded DNA segment that includes the lesion, creating a single-strand
  gap in the DNA. That is subsequently filled in by DNA polymerase, which uses the
  undamaged strand as a template. NER can be divided into two subpathways (blobal
  genomic NER and transcription coupled NER) that differ only in their recognition
  of helix-distorting DNA damage. Nucleotide excision repair has more complexity in
  eukaryotes.   Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a particularly important DNA repair
  mechanism as evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic
  mutations of NER proteins including xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome.  This
  pathway was adapted from [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa03420),
  [REPAIRtoire](http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/2/), and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide_excision_repair).
  The pathway layout is based on KEGG.
