description: The precursor to asparagine is oxaloacetate, which the AAT enzyme converts
  to aspartate by transferring the amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate, producing
  α-ketoglutarate and aspartate. The enzyme ASN produces asparagine, AMP, glutamate,
  and pyrophosphate from aspartate, glutamine, and ATP.  Description adapted from
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagine Wikipedia].
