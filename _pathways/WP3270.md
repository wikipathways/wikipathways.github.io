description: 'The principal pathways for metabolism of codeine occur in the liver,
  although some metabolism occurs in the intestine and brain. Approximately 50-70%
  of codeine is converted to codeine-6-glucuronide by UGT2B7. Codeine-6-glucuronide
  has a similar affinity to codeine for the mu opioid receptor, coded for by the OPRM1
  gene. Approximately 10-15% of codeine is N-demethylated to norcodeine by CYP3A4.
  Norcodeine also has a similar affinity to codeine for the mu opioid receptor. Between
  0-15% of codeine is O-demethylated to morphine, the most active metabolite, which
  has 200 fold greater affinity for the mu opioid receptor compared to codeine. This
  metabolic reaction is performed by CYP2D6.  Approximately 60% of morphine is glucuronidated
  to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) while 5-10% is glucuronidated to morphine-6-glucuronide
  (M6G). These reactions are principally catalyzed by UGT2B7 in the liver. UGT1A1
  may have a minor role in the formation of M3G , and UGT1A1 and UGT1A8 are capable
  of catalyzing the formation of M6G in vitro and so contribute to this pathway, although
  UGT1A8 is minimally expressed in liver and so is not depicted here. M6G has a higher
  affinity for OPRM1 than morphine and M3G and so the ratio of morphine to M6G is
  considered an important indicator of analgesic effect.  Transporters are also depicted
  in this pathway, as they influence clearance of codeine, morphine and their metabolites.
  Some of the evidence for the involvement of these transporters was derived from
  experiments done in mice and may or may not be translatable to human pharmacokinetics.
  The transporters present at the blood-brain barrier, not depicted in this pathway,
  as well as metabolic enzymes and transporters in the brain and GI tract, likely
  also play an important role in the pharmacokinetics of codeine and morphine.  Sources:
