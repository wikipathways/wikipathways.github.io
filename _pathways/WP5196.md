description: Metabolic pathway of N-glycan biosynthesis in Ovis aries (sheep). N-linked
  glycosylation is the process where an oligosaccharide is transferred from a lipid
  carrier to an asparagine residue of a polypeptide. The first steps of N-linked glycosylation
  take place on the surface of the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), while further remodeling
  is performed in the Golgi apparatus. The modification in the Golgi apparatus is
  species-, cell-type-, and protein-specific which provides a very broad structural
  diversity in N-glycans.  Broadly speaking, the role of protein-linked glycans is
  to function as specific binding determinants or modulators of the proteins that
  they are attached to.  View original pathway at https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?oas00510
