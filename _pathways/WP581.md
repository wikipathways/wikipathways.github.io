description: 'The erythropoietin receptor is a 66 kDa peptide and is a member of the
  cytokine receptor family. The receptor is tyrosine phosphorylated upon binding by
  erythropoietin and associates with and activates the tyrosine kinase, JAK2, which
  activates different intracellular pathways including: Ras/MAP kinase, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase and STAT transcription factors. The stimulated erythropoietin receptor
  appears to have a role in erythroid cell survival. Defects in the erythropoietin
  receptor may produce erythroleukemia and familial erythrocytosis. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin_receptor)  This
  pathway is based on ScienceSlides.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays
  available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP581)'
