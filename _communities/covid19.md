title: "Welcome to the COVID-19 Pathway community page!"

description: "This community fouses on curating the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19. It is part of a larger community effort called the [COVID-19 Disease Map](https://covid.pages.uni.lu/). After an initial comment in 2020 in Scientific Data [Ostaszewski, et al.](http://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0477-8), a longer paper from the whole community was published in 2021 in Molecular Systems Biology: [Ostaszewski, et al.](https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.202110387). More recently, the community is working on a paper focused on different analysis and modelling approaches using the COVID-19 Disease Map, currently available on bioXriv [Niarakis, et al.](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.17.520865)"

contribute: "We are helping to coordinate an international effort to build and curate pathway models relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. If you find or add a pathway at WikiPathways that should be included in this collection, please let us know by contacting Martina Kutmon (mkutmon[AT]gmail.com). Resources to get started:

* [Published pathway figures related to COVID-19](https://gladstone-bioinformatics.shinyapps.io/shiny-covidpathways/)

* [Protein sequence alignments of SARS-CoV-2](https://alexanderpico.github.io/SARS-CoV-2_Alignments/)

* [COVID-19 disease map initiative](https://covid.pages.uni.lu/map_curation): a broader community of pathway curators working with WikiPathways, Pathway Commons, Reactome, Cell Designer and more.

* [Human Coronavirus protein identifiers](https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/sparql/virusProteinsAll.code.html) and [SARS-CoV-2 protein identifiers](https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/sparql/virusProteins.code.html)

* [PubChem list of the COVID-19 Portal pathways](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#query=coronavirus&tab=pathway)

* [KG COVID-19](https://knowledge-graph-hub.github.io/kg-covid-19-dashboard/): a knowledge graph aggregating many sources as RDF"
