description: "The CPTAC Community highlights pathway content relevant to the [Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac) (CPTAC).
CPTAC is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of robust, quantitative, proteomic technologies and workflows. The pathways in this portal include comprehensive cancer-type specific models for several of the CPTAC cancer types, pathways describing processes affected in specific cancer types as well as many pathways describing normal biological processes that are known to be important in cancer biology. The CPTAC pathways at WikiPathways have been organized into [classic cancer hallmark](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21376230) categories, based on the different biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors."
