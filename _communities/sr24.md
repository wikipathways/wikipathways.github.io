description: "The [Serious Request](https://www.npo3fm.nl/kominactie) 2024 action is to raise funding for [MetaKids](https://metakids.nl/),
  a Dutch foundation that aims for a world in which metabolic diseases can be treated or prevented and
  where no kid has to suffers from these diseases.
  
  <p>This WikiPathways actions aims to raise funding for the Serious Request 2024 action and in return
  we will work in December on improving the digitalized versions of the latest literature about the
  biological process that are behind or could perhaps explain these metabolic diseases.
  
 <p>This page lists the pathways we worked on during the action or are otherwise relevant to
  the work by the MetaKids foundation. We further have <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/wikipathways/projects/2/views/1\">this project board</a>
  to monitor the specific tasks, in an open notebook science sense. Also, a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.wikipathways.org/sr24-curation/\">curation website</a>
  is maintained.
  
  <p>See also the \"WikiPathways in actie voor MetaKids\" <a href=\"https://www.npo3fm.nl/kominactie/acties/wikipathways-in-actie-voor-metakids\">page</a> where you can donate money for MetaKids.
  It has been reported that people outside The Netherlands can use PayPal to make donations.

  <h2>Work done</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>On Friday curation continued on the new pathways but also other focus pathways, decreasing the number of points brought up on <a href=\"https://www.wikipathways.org/sr24-curation/index2.html\">this curation page</a>.</li>
  <li>Thursday resulted in (major) improvements to WP5504 and WP5505, and two new pathways from two new contributors (Daan and Marek): <a href=\"https://classic.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5506\">WP5506</a> and <a href=\"https://classic.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5507\">WP5507</a>.</li>
  <li>On Wednesday we used the full list of 1384 genes to add about 30 additional pathways to our <a href=\"https://www.wikipathways.org/sr24-curation/\">curation focus list</a>.</li>
  <li>On Tuesday a new pathway was started from the list of 347 genes: <a href=\"https://classic.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5505\">WP5505</a>.</li>
  <li>On Monday we compared 1384 genes with WikiPathways and Reactome: 347 and and 129 were not in the database respectively.</li>
  <li>On Sunday a new metabolite ID mapping database was created, and a first new pathway was drawn: <a href=\"https://classic.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5504\">WP5504</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pathways planned to work on</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Pathways directly linked to diseases currently mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.unitedformetabolicdiseases.nl/publicaties.php\">research articles</a> by <a href=\"https://www.unitedformetabolicdiseases.nl/\">United for Metabolic Diseases</a>, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP4156\">WP4156</a></li>
  <li>Pathways describing <a href=\"https://www.wikipathways.org/search.html?query=mitochondria\">mitochondrial processes</a></li>
  <li>Pathways not digitized in <a href=\"https://imd.wikipathways.org\">the book behind the IMD portal</a>, see <a href=\"https://classic.wikipathways.org/index.php/Portal:IEM/CoveredPathways\">this table</a></li>
